For all the years of the school they were inseparable, then Ethan went far away for college but they remained best friends and sometimes Ethan turned back home to see Will. And for Will was pain and pleasure cause Will was deeply in love with his friend and had no courage to admit it, especially not to Ethan who seemed to have plenty of women around him.But one night, maybe thanks to some much drinks, Will and Ethan confess thier mutual feelings, and make passionate love. Will also declares his love to Ethan. But the morning after, Ethan has to leave in a hurry, and can't explain to Will why and where and doesn't know when he will be back. He only asks to Will to never let go him and his love for him.But Ethan can return only three years after, without any words in between, and Will has not maintain his promise, he has let go and he has moved on, try to find someone else... but this is not true, cause his love for Ethan is not dead and flares to new life when his lover is again near him. But Ethan is not the same man he was when he has left, and Will has to change to deal with this new man.The plot is simple and somewhat cosy: the external world is only hint and never really break into this novel. Will and Ethan are first friends and then lovers, and this allow them to be able to trust themself without much words to explain the past. If not for the friendship between then, it will really impossible to believe true Will's behaviour, when hungry will turn suddenly in hunger for his lover's soul and body.",5,1
"The story started out a little slow, but then snowballed! Into a page turner! Very we'll written and captivating.  A good getting to know the protagonist intro then things started moving faster and deeper. I really enjoyed this story and will look for more by this author!",4,1
"What a fun story. It has everything I like about paranormal suspense type stories, with the added bonus of m/m.I loved Vic right from the start and cannot wait to learn more about him and his abilities. Aside from the psy aspect, he seems like such a normal guy with his insecurities and witty humor. I love Vic with Jacob, who sounds like total hotness. The sex is somewhat understated, which I think only makes it steamier in the end.I also loved both female characters. Carolyn is the perfect psy partner for Jacob, and Lisa is interesting as well. I'm looking forward to watching Lisa learn to use her ability and hope to see these two in future books.I absolutely loved the ending. What a way to wrap things up and leave me running to get the next installment. My only real complaint is that it is way to short and was over too fast.",4,1
"The main character telling this story is a man, but the female author made a mistake doing that, because he is not convincing.  His thoughts, detailed descriptions, and reactions are way too feminine, and the effect is jarring.",2,0
"The introduction was fairly smooth but regrettably became rushed and stilted about 20% in the book. The plot has merit, but obviously needs more than basic editing. Work needs done on transitions and clarity. I almost stopped reading it became so trite and unbelievable. Happy ending of course, but that is why I like romances. Won't be paying for any of this author's books, she needs to slow down and write properly.",1,0
"Maybe it isn't fair to start a review by complaining of the excessive length of this fascinating story.  But even Red Adept in her review highlights that problem right at the start.  And, to be fair. from about 60% of the way through the book I kept wondering when it would ever end.  So the extreme and unnecessary length was a key factor in my reading this book.Now, to be clear, I love long novels.  My favorite book (Tai-Pan by James Clavell) is over 700 pages.  This book I would estimate at about 650 pages (it is 14800+ locations on the Kindle).  And I continually read long books, but mostly in historical fiction- NOT action/adventure.  Those books are usually about 350-450 pages, which would have been the right length for this book.  Only Tom Clancy writes such long action thrillers (like Debt of Honor), but even those books are too long, and he is a best selling author- not a new writer.  So this book needed substantial trimming- I'd reduce it by at least 25% and probably closer to 35%.  There are only so many times you need to read about the characters escaping from the villains.Now, having complained about the length, I will state that the plot was terrific- Mozart in the 21st century, escaping death in the 1790's by the modern day evil company's time machine that brought him to today.  And, then, with his love interest Elisse, trying to escape from their clutches.  I would have preferred more about his music, but the portrayal of Mozart was quite fun.  It is very evident to me that the author based his characterization on Tom Hulce's performance in the movie ""Amadeus"".  (Note that in the book the movie is mentioned several times- so this connection is no accident).I must mention one fantastic scene where Mozart gets into a fiddle contest against Rainman in a honky tonk bar in New Orleans- Mozart plays his Stradivarius.  A real hoot!The time travel aspects, and the back story of the evil company and its device and manipulations are never revealed much- and that is OK.  The emphasis is on Mozart and his escape from his imprisonment.In short, I liked the book,and the premise very much- but the  book was much too long.  A major trimming would have helped enormously. (I downgraded it one star for the length.)A final word on the Kindle formatting.  I did not find it as troubling as the previous reviewers.  There were some errors, but not that many.",3,1
"Usually, this type of book is right in the sweet spot of work that I love. It is a shame therefore for me to say that I just did not get this work. The book did not capture my enthusiasm either in terms of characters or the universe that was being portrayed.",2,0
"Annabelle Lee by N.J. WaltersI liked this story.  It started off with Annabelle the librarian, having an erotic dream about the sexy and hot Mike and ended with the dream as a reality.What is it about librarian's that fire the imagination into all kinds of naughty fantasies?  Hmm...",4,1
This book was such an inspirational story that I enjoyed reading very much.  It made me realize how easily a person's life can be changed within seconds.  This is one book that everyone would enjoy reading no matter what type book you usually buy.,5,1

"Ross Benson, Viscount Winterton, is recently returned from Africa.  He is a jaded rake of a man, and the object of many women's fantasies.  He and Timothy Rollins are arriving back at Ivydale Manor, drunk, when they wake young Cassandra, Timothy's sister, who helps both men to bed.  When she ends up in bed with Ross, her lifetime crush, it will have repercussions none of them counted on.Ross is handsome, sought after and has never had an inclination toward innocent young women.  For some unfathomable reason, Cassandra tempts him like no woman has before.  When he seduces her on a night of drunken stupor, he has no choice but to marry the alluring Cassandra.In a Reckless Moment is a charming story of opposites attracting.  Ross and Cassandra burn up the pages as their explosive chemistry is the foundation for building a marriage from convenience to a forever love.  Cassandra is a woman many will appreciate for her independence, her common sense and her genuine love for Ross and her family.  She is warm and witty, charming and beautiful.  With not a vain bone in her body, she endeared herself to me even further.  Ross, on the other hand, is a charming and handsome rogue; he is jaded and spoiled until Cassandra brings him down a few pegs.  He is clueless about love and it is with baited breath that this reader watched as he fell further under Cassandra's spell each day.  With the underlying mystery of Ross's past to keep this reader guessing, I was intrigued by the storyline, both the journey to falling in love and the mystery of threats to the couple's safety.  I thoroughly enjoyed Emma Wildes' In a Reckless Moment and I intend to purchase all of the previous titles.Scarletreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",5,1
"I dont' think I realized this was a novella when I purchased the book, however it was very sweet. I like the idea of the male romance author right away and was amused by the antics between the two main characters. Sweet, short, but left me wishing for a full length version. I probably read this in about thirty minutes.",3,1
"I gotta tell you that I first heard about this series of books a few years back and was not at all interested and then I fell face first into ""the end of the world as we know it"" when I became a fan of Glenn Beck and took off my blinders and really saw what is happening to this country and to our so called civilized world.  As a military veteran I have found this series to be a blast to read.  The character development is such that you really get to know them and it hurts you when one of them is hurt or God forbid killed.  The author makes it a point to let you know the good guy dosen't always win or live to see tomorrow.  Do what I did and get the entire series and read them one right after the other.  You won't be dissapointed that is until you run out of books to read.  I can't wait until the next one.  Oh by the way if ""vampires"" are your thing well this book will be right up your alley.",5,1
i can't really expand on what the others have said since they hit the nail on the head. i can only assume the good reviews were from friends of the author. this book was such a disappointment. there was so much wrong there are no redeeming qualities.,1,0

"This is totally a beauty and the beast pre-quel to the main books in the series.  It's mildly entertaining but isn't going to keep you wanting more.What I found most surprising was that in choosing to have a ""sample"" of the bundle sent to me I got this book in it's entirety.  I think that says more about the book than I can.I'm still debating the actual purchase of the bundle.",2,0
"LIGHT SPOILERS- I  don't give a plot summary or any major spoilers, but I do refer to a few things not mentioned in the product description, since that is only 1 line long. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Stand-alone dragon centric paranormal romance. As another reviewer commented, don't bother with this book unless it is turned into a series. I liked the writing style, but this story turned out terribly. Most of the book it was 3 - 4 stars, but the ending ruined it completely.PLOT & STYLE: Plot was a fun concept- the set up for potential erotic encounters and romance was hot, the mythology surrounding the dragons was heartbreaking and had depth. There was a TON of potential here, but it was never borne out. WAAAAY too much of the book was spent in Marlee's head. My eyes crossed there was so much of her thought process on the darn page. You get a little from other character perspectives, but it was just swamped with pages and pages of what was running through her mind. The action, when we got to it, was well done. It was well written and vibrant, just got muddled in narration. Not enough use of the dragon mythology or magic, however. Minimal shifting.CHARACTERS: Overall I'd say they were a fun cast of characters. The brothers spent too much time fighting, but it would have been ok if they had found harmony at some point. Some attempt was made to develop them a bit but only Marlee really took on much depth. The brothers were sympathetic and sexy when not shooting each other dirty looks.SEXUAL CONTENT: Considering the set up, it was lacking. There was LOTS of sex- explicit, lusty, and pulse racing sex, but it was all one woman with different partners. There was little variety or creativity- no true m&eacute;nage, no voyeurism, no kink, no anal, nothing outside of basic passionate sex. What sex there was certainly was erotic, but it wasn't anything really interesting. There were 6 sexy brothers, for goodness sakes, which would have lent itself to all kinds of fun possibilities. But no, instead we were subjected to childish bickering around who got to ""get her"" next. Tiresome.MAJOR ISSUE: The ending basically made the whole book feel like a waste of time. There were a number of very specific things I can think of that would have made it more interesting and more satisfying. Instead, the whole thing feels like it was all a happy accident that will have no real way of working out long term. A number of very important plot points are not resolved at all:* no sense of lasting love or having a future as a family (she never even figures out she's pregnant with triplets- she still thinks it's just ONE kid at the end, even when all the brothers know better)* no harmony between brothers* no satisfying explanation for Marlee's involvement*  no explanation for how on earth she could have gotten pregnant with a third child after already being 4 weeks along with her first two* no resolution of the whole ""we're the last dragons on earth"" issue* no explanation for their suddenly being able to shift* no explanation for why the government got involved or why they were so interested in Marlee... or why we have any reason to believe they aren't still looking for her* no explanation of why they hadn't bothered to check out their mother's cave until the end of this book after hundreds of years of not knowing anything about being dragonsThe whole thing ends very suddenly as if the editor called and said ""I NEED IT NOW"" and the author took 15 minutes to whip together an ending. It felt like a cop out and was pretty darn irritating. The ONLY way this could be fixed is with a sequel that picks up where this leaves off, because it sure as heck wasn't finished.BOTTOM LINE: This reads like a one night stand that got complicated. There are better options available. If a second book comes out that finishes this story, I'll revise my review.RECOMMENDATIONS- go with these instead:1. Keri Arthur's spin on dragon romance inDestiny Kills (Myth and Magic, Book 1)2. Katie Macalister's humorous & sexy take on dragons, demons and more inYou Slay Me (Aisling Grey, Guardian, Book 1)this is urban fantasy more than romance3. Sydney Somers' gargoyle spin on romance:Primal Hunger: Pendragon Gargoyles, Book 14. G.A. Aiken'sDragon Actually (Dragon Kin, Book 1)- outrageous, funny and sexy dragon themed paranormal romance5. Marie Harte'sRachel's Totem- lighter, less developed para-erotica featuring a variety of shifters in a quirky little town- features m&eacute;nage6. Marie Harte'sRoane (Circe's Recruits 1)- para-erotica around genetically engineered shifters who bond through sexual connections- features intense m&eacute;nage7. Anna Leigh Keaton'sFalke's Peak- para-erotica featuring m&eacute;nage with cat shifters, sweeter, more subtle story",2,0
I must not have read the same book as everyone else. This book had much potential but very little character development Android interpersonal relationships were non existant. Cat was boring Android temperamental Android judgemental. Tegan deserved a better mate. Secondary cast of characters if developed for more than a sentence could have been ok. But Cat made the book awful.,1,0

I have read almost all of Ms. James books. This is by far my favorite. Anyone that has been married for a length of time can relate. Saying what you think and feel is not always easy. Also wanting or needing it is easy to become so focused you alienate the other person. She did such a brilliant job of showing that. It is so clear that they love each other you can't help but root for them.  It will bring a tear to your eye but in the end you smile because meant to be is sometimes enough.,5,1

"I liked the creative ideas, the making and building of items.  The whole story was great...except for the killing of so many animals.  the book was written at a different time in the history of the world, the language is interesting to read and understand.

"THIS BOOK IS REVOLTING!!!!Is Jackie Christian a woman or man? I can not believe that a woman would write such trash.There is NO plot, the story jumped from one thing to another there was no flow. The characters are the worst kind of trailer park trash. You read a book to get away from everyday life not to be repeatedly disgusted by not only the language that the women use but the authors use of urination on people. Too much watching of porn videos i think. What 19 yr old virgin would get turned on by someone giving them a ""golden shower""? Plus getting rejected by the UPS guy then going to watch said guy strip in a club. The language in it is appalling and I was embarrassed for the authors lack of vocabulary.The UPS guy was an idiot, all the women made you want to slap them upside the head.The ending was stupid. After repeated rejection she finally says yes to her toy boy??? WHAT THE HELL????I wouldn't even give this 1 star and I WOULD NOT recommend this author or book to anyone nor will i read anything buy this author again.I will in future be sticking to authors like Diana Palmer, Linda Howard, Julia Quinn and Suzanne Enoch who have enough respect for themselves not to write trash like this.",1,0

"An awful, rushed, careless cowboy imitation of The Clans of Kalquor, a much better series.*SPOILERS*The brothers practically jumped on her at first sight, groping and dominating her within hours without any consideration to her feelings at all. They take her virginity without even slowing down or preparing her, *all* of her virginity. They find out how old she was, almost a hundred years ago, and *gasp* she's suddenly jailbait. ""Oh ick, we don't want you any more, and we don't care about your safety either""There was nothing redeemable about this book at all. I read almost everything else by this author and loved it all.

"Nyssa is a spoiled brat at the beginning of this story. Sadly, she doesn't improve much: she doesn't seem to mature at all as the plot progresses, despite supposedly falling in love and learning things that should have offered perspective. She's whiny, rude, and selfish right to the end. Theron, the titular Guardian, is described as a highly engineered dominant protector. He was more appealing than Nyssa, but the near-instant and repeated collapse of his deeply ingrained discipline around her made me roll my eyes. The ""futuristic"" vocabulary chosen by the author also detracted from any potential romance.",2,0

I liked a lot about this book but there were parts that I thought went just a little bit too far.I like the authors style and this is the second book I've bought because of it but I do wonder what type of a person would have felt I was ok to publish parts of it.I guess that helps the books to sell to some people and I will buy more from this author knowing what to expect.If it was toned down in a couple of areas I would have given it 5 stars.,4,1

"Among the Living is the first novella in the Psycop series, the beginning of everything, the starting point of an amazing saga that compresses several genres, including erotic romance, sci-fi, thriller, paranormal and suspense. Wow. Not an easy task and so wonderfully done. Here we meet Victor Baynes &#8220;Vic&#8221; the half of a paranormal investigation unit otherwise known as a &#8220;Spook Squad&#8221;. He is able to talk to dead people and even see them sometimes which is particularly useful as he investigates homicides. He&#8217;s a quirky character. Besides and because of his PRN habilities, Vic is quite neurotic and snarky, addicted to pharmaceuticals that allows him to escape the haunted ones when he&#8217;s overwhelmed, and not very successful in the dating department. Also, he has not sense of style whatsoever and is forever soiling his clothes and buying replacements in cheap stores. Not a clotheshorse our boy. But oh so lovable.At his non psychic partner&#8217;s retirement party and while under the influence of one too many pills, he meets another &#8220;stiff&#8221;, Jacob Marks and they engage in a little tryst in a bathroom. Jacob is his opposite, non psychic, super hottie, very built and dressed to the tenths. Shortly after, Vic is called to a crime scene where he&#8217;s nonplussed he can&#8217;t catch any &#8220;vibes&#8221; from the victim. From then on we get to know other important people in the Psycop&#8217;s universe, like Gutierrez, who was supposed to be his new partner and also Jacob&#8217;s spook partner. All of them come together, one way or another in the investigation of an apparent serial killer preying on gay men.The book is written from Vic&#8217;s POV in a very straightforward prose, no &#8220;purplerism&#8221;, no overuse of adjectives/adverbs. There are not &#8220;astonishingly aquamarine orbs&#8221; in Ms. Castillo Price writing. Thanks all the Gods and Goddesses in Valhalla for that. The focus is both in the characters and the plot, which is extremely original, innovative, humorous,  uber sexy and absolutely captivating. The suspense is tightly wowen and the story is fast paced.It took me about two years to start reading JCP&#8217;s books in spite of them being highly recommended all over. Sci-Fi was never my thing neither PRN so I was quite skeptic and couldn&#8217;t be bother to try it. Finally, I gave up and read this one. Let me tell you, it was lurve at first page. Hi, I&#8217;m a JPCholic and I don&#8217;t want to be cured. Ever.  I&#8217;ve read almost everything she has published and of course I started with this cool, awesome series.Up to now, there are seven books ( the first three are novella length) and several more free short stories than you can download for free, including one of Vic & Jacob  before they actually met each other. This fantastic, amazing universe starts here and slowly grows and develops. Book after book we get to know more about them, their backround, their life stories as we witness the development of V&J; &#8216;s romance while they fight their way solving the most befuddling and weird of cases. And it only gets better.Jordan Castillo Price is in my not so humble opinion, the Queen and Supreme Goddess of m/m suspense romance, up there in the  fiction authors&#8217; Olympus. Her books are a must for any smart reader who appreciates gay fiction but not exclusively. It&#8217;s just great fiction, among the best at the risk of sounding hyperbolic.If you wonder why I gave 4 starts instead of 5, just only because this is the first one in a long series, a little taste of what it&#8217;s to come. Psycop is a 5+ read. Say no more.",4,1

Quentin is struck by his young partner's willingness to take chances, to reach out to other people, to women no less.  Ralph leaves everyone in his wake smiling and feeling good about themselves, from the hostess in the local barbeque joint to the battle-axe receptionist who ends up giggling at the incorrigible young man. Ralph's antics remind Quentin how long it has been since he's felt joy and pride in his life much less caused it in others.Regina is caught in the ugly and dispiriting cycle of an abusive marriage.

"This is a very hot, very engaging, very intriguing story that pulled me in, made me feel, descriptive and well-done as far as creating a plot instead of just throwing a few sex scenes together, but then just when it was really getting good ... I get the ""read the next installment"" message. Like so many people, I'm really getting tired of a story just getting going and then hitting a wall and having to shell out cash to read more (sometimes a little, sometimes a heck of a lot).  I understand the reasoning behind it from the income for the author side of things, but I fell for that with one story that started out great, spent $3.99 for the next installment just to have it fall flat (which made me very glad I'd only paid for part 2, and didn't buy parts 3 and 4 ahead of time!) Once burned and all that. Will I pay for  more of this story?  Perhaps, but not immediately.",4,1

As I read the book, I could easily envision where it was going and how it would get there. I'd turn a couple of pages and there it was! Just the way I would have written it myself.Even the ending was so trite that I'm surprised the friend / husband of Maria wasn't named Joseph or Joe. That would have turned this into an out and out parody of the birth of Jesus. It was so close to that already it could have been written by Bevis and Buthead. The author should be ashamed.",1,0

I have really enjoyed the this author's previous work and was looking forward to a what I thought would be a story about a reluctant h and a remorseful H that had to woo the h back in love with him.  Since this never happened, I am not sure why the book had this title.  Other than the H carrying a box for the h and giving her a kitten, there really was no wooing at all.  They have sex and then he reacts like a total jerk after they are done but instead of apologizing he gives her a lame line of ""what I did was unforgivable so I am not going to ask you to forgive me.""  This was after he has locked her in a jail cell for her to listen to him (his the sheriff).  I guess even after what she did I thought that how he acted he needed to get on his knees to beg for forgiveness and really showing remorse instead of acting high handed but he continually doubts and compares the h to the actions of his ex-wife.  When the h intervenes between his daughter and him, the H immediate response is ""you told her,"" referring to a secret that the H had shared with the h regarding the daughter.  She let's that go and then later in the book he also questions her honesty regarding a major event which to me was just the last straw.  He is just one of those characters that because he had been burned once before and therefore will forever continue to think the worse of all women, the h included.  He never once believed the best of the h nor did he really have to ever work for the h love.  Instead the H continually took her for granted.  The h is just disappointing because throughout the book she stand up to the H just long enough to give lip service just before she lays down to be his doormat.  The end was just so unbelievably annoying that I didn't even read the last two pages.  Yes, I had two pages to go and I just could not do it.  H shows up after continually treating the h like crap and hurting her and in one paragraph all is fine and well, until the next time that life doesn't go his way and then somehow that will be the h fault again and I'm sure she will agree with that as well.  The only time he steps up is when someone else wanted her or if it was easy and convenient to him, this to me this a romance does not make.  This book was just a huge disappointment especially from such a talented author.",2,0
"In order to save his pawned guitar, Ted Hogwood accepts an assignment from a branch of the government that isn't even official. His partner on this assignment is Jerry Kwiatkowski and their mission is to steal a boomerang that contains secrets that should have died with J. Edgar Hoover. What stands in their path? A crossbow wielding assassin, two unemployed Australian women, the director of Central Intelligence and an ex-cheerleader!Got your attention yet? Is your eyebrow raised? It should be! This book was a really fun read and Alan's writing style reminded me at times of the late Douglas Adams. The deeper into the plot you get, the more you can tell the characters are in a situation that's way over their heads. It's quirky, funny and really hard to put down. I found myself wondering how this all would come together and then when it did I was highly amused. It was really sad when this fun trip ended and I do hope to see these characters again somewhere down the road.",5,1
"I thought this was a good story with a lot of potential,but felt like it ended just as it was getting good.  There were enough characters and potential plot lines for it to have gone at least twice as long if not more.",4,1
I absolutely loved this story. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down and read it in one sitting. I loved the characters and the way that things worked out. The relationship flows fairly realistically for everything involved. The way that it went was believable for me. I loved the action in this story and the way that things flowed. This story won't bore you. I can't wait to read more in the series.,5,1
"Luke and his two friends, Michael and Henry, are determined to change humans' opinions about their kind.  To do this, they need the assistance of some humans in the entertainment industry.  They decide to go with Calypso Productions, but the meeting is a disaster.  In the end, Luke asks one of the women to meet again somewhere else, hoping he can convince her to help in a less formal setting.  The woman, Lena, asks him to dinner.  Though he's nervous--and attracted to Lena--Luke agrees.Lena has risen to a position of influence as a founding member of Calypso Productions.  Together with her three friends, she's one of Hollywood's young elite.  Normally she would blow off a guy who gives a presentation as awkwardly as Luke and his friends did.  Since she finds him attractive, however, she asks him to dinner with the intention of seducing him.  Will Lena still want Luke when she discovers what he and his friends are?Lights, Camera...Monsters is a cute and interesting tale of what happens when an up-and-coming Hollywood businesswoman meets a monster, literally.  Lena is secure in her own place in the world, and proud of her accomplishments.  She's tough and knows what she wants.  Luke, with his mixture of toughness and tenderness, confidence and vulnerability, throws her for a loop.  The scene in which she first sees Luke's true form is really funny.  I liked Luke's navet&eacute; regarding human customs, and his uncertainty.  He softened some of Lena's grating edges.  The storyline itself is engaging, with lots of sex, some action and suspense, and a rather unusual take on the paranormal/monster genre.  Secondary characters, including Luke's friends and Lena's business partners, are clearly destined for their own stories.  If you like the paranormal but are getting tired of the same old creatures, Lights, Camera...Monsters is a good choice.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",5,1

"I like a lot of Evangeline Anderson's books, but this one left me feeling a little cold. I liked the premise of the story where Kristen is addicted to vampire venom and that her mechanic is a vampire and can help her with her addiction. But then they go to a D/s club and it just got too uncomfortable, parts where she was saying no, but was ""forced"" because is was the master. Personally I don't enjoy reading that so it was a real turn-off for me, hence the lower rating. You may enjoy this more if you like this type of book (and no, I never finished FSOG).",2,0
"I am torn, I am a HUGE fan of Maya's KGI series. Her KGI books are very well written with excellent character and story line development. This book was well written, but the story line was definitely was not my style. It's a story about a woman having 3 brothers sharing her and she is pregnant. If you like this type of story line then read it, I'm sure you will enjoy it.",2,0
"Quinn and Libby McKay had been together for fourteen years, but for the last three months, Libby had been living by herself after kicking her husband out.  She couldn't go on the way they had been.  They were no more than roommates, and she decided to either shake things up, or let go and move on.  It had truly shocked her that he seemed to take it in stride until he saw her dancing with someone else one night at Ziggy's.  Quinn had lost his temper, and that gave her some hope, but when he walked away not wanting to cause a scene, she was ready to give up.When Quinn showed up at the library waiting at her car, Libby didn't know what to think.  Hearing him ask for a second chance, and his proposition that she spend a weekend alone with him, she didn't know what to think.  Libby was further surprised to hear his agreement that he would give her time to think after their time together that was uninterrupted and free from pressure.  They had been so far apart from each other the past year that Libby was afraid to get her hopes up.  Knowing this was their last chance, she skeptically agreed.This was a different spin in that we witness the demise of a good marriage between two basically kind hearted people.  They allowed other issues come between them, and instead of tackling them head on, they tried to deal with them alone separating them farther.  Can these two find the path back to each other?  A good read with strong characters.  Rough Rider readers will appreciate this story.",4,1
"I don't know how I feel about this book. It was okay. I didn't enjoy it enough to want to continue the series anytime soon.

But it seems like Vic pyschic abilities is getting more and more sensitive. In fact, Vic is causing Bodily Harm to Jacob. What is up with the dead getting so touchy-feely and why are there so many more of them...even in his apartment?Lisa Guitterez, his old partner, keeps calling him and leaving cryptic messages about Vic being in danger, but Vic can't decipher the meaning. Who is after Vic and why?the writing is good, but the story isn't that interesting. I actually wish they would bring Lisa back because I love her Si-No ability and I find her and Carolyn to be more interesting than Jacob and Vic. Plus, there wasn't enough Romance in this story to make me happy. So I can't say that i enjoyed this one that much. (less)",3,1

"Aside from the clich&eacute;d marathon sex in this book I was left pretty confused by the ending as to what exactly I had just read. Did she dream it? Does he recognized her? I'm not really complaining because it's free and I did enjoy reading it for the most part, but there was nothing very special about it and the ""twist"" if that's what you call it at the end really just left me scratching my head. A bit of fluff with not a lot of substance, this book is fine if you are just browsing for something free to read because there's really nothing more than that to it.",3,1
I really enjoyed this book. It was different than most I've read. It actually used older cha r caters which just made the book great. The humor in it made me laugh.,5,1
I hesitate to use the word porn but this book was really close. This had the sensuality rating of E and it was too much. I am far from a prude but everyone has to  draw the line somewhere. This was it for me. I will probably stay away from this publisher let alone try a book at the X level. (Levels set by the publisher.),1,0
"I wanted to like this book, having loved reading and bookstores my entire life. But the book isn't about someone who loves reading or bookstores. I got tired of all the clueless people, the sermons on the evils of electronic books causing the extinction of all bookstores. The irony of reading this in Kindle format especially when a similar device called a Gizmo from an online purveyor called the Nile was a focus of this book finally got to me. I was just too bored to continue reading. Oh, I gave it every chance to reawaken my interest by reading the final chapter. What I discovered was that removing the book from my device was inevitable.",2,0
"This book left me so disappointed, I don't even know where to begin with my review. First of all I would have given it a 1 star, but I didn't because some parts of the book was very interesting and I could actually vision it. I even laughed at a few parts because of how real the situation was. Now, to begin on my disappointments with this book. For one, I didn't like how each scene ended so abruptly. Soon as a scene started to get good, it cut right off and went straight to the next scene. Then on top of that, when it did, it was either days, a week, weeks, or months later. We didn't get full details about what happened with certain situations, and we didn't get enough details on the characters. Next, there wasn't much drama in the book. We were introduced to atleast 2 ghetto chicks, one whom clearly had no problem fighting. The first was dec's cousin (forgot his name), who was very very ghetto. She was at the mall with the so called gangsta, when some ghetto chick whom he had some type of past with. I mean she stepped to tabitha straight away once she saw her with dude, and not once did a fight break out. In real life a fight would have broke out for sure, smh sad but true. There were a few typos and grammatical errors, which wasn't much of a big deal since there weren't many.What put the icing on the cake, tabitha was just so freaking stupid. Yea most of the dudes she dated wasn't worth her time, and were so lame. But there were atleast 2 of them which she had no reason at all to complain about. Her husband craig is EVERYTHING any female in her right mind would want. Good father, good sex, good to her, good looks, etc. And this dumb b***h let him go over internet flirting. Are you serious? some ppl would consider that cheating to, but I'd rather have my man online just flirting, and not actually out there cheating and screwing the women like most cheaters out here. Her simple a** talking about ""he lied about his online flirting"". B***h should be lucky that's all he was doing, like wtf. This s*** got me so freaking heated on how ugrateful this chick is. Then had the nerve to get mad at him for moving on, when SHE is the one to drop him. Sounds to me she wanted things exactly her way, and at the same time have her cake and eat it to. She put all the blame on the dudes, when she got upset over dumb s***. Then the mysterious ""confused"" guy she met online, that was going through the SAME EXACT S*** AS HER. I mean they were each others double basically, and she even admitted to being able to tell him stuff she couldn't talk to her own male best friend about; And not once did she consider he could be the one. Her male bestfriend was just as dumb as her and clearly bipolar or had split personality; because one minute he was telling her to have options and do the dating thing. Next minute, he was telling her she needed to try and settle down. He was the one that set her up with his ghetto a** cousin, and saying he was all talk and blah blah blah. Whole time he was 100% wrong, and was shocked at the last minute when he went stalker on her. It's very clear dudes don't know other dudes all to well, and can give a female wrong advice on their own species. The ending had me like ""WTF...it's ending just like that?"". Huge disappointment. She let 2 guys in this book who was everything she actually wanted, but let them go cause she was obviously bipolar, NOT CONFUSED. Yo If I knew this chick tabitha in real life, I would dig in her s*** so bad, and make her feel like the dumbest person on earth. NO WONDER SHE IS STILL SINGLE, because she don't know a good man when she see's one, and got a huge nerve to blame the s*** on them. She is a dumb a** b***h!",2,0

"The species work was good and well as the emotions. However, more plot would have been nice and follow up at the HEA.Spolier!!!!!!!My main issue with the book is the fact that there were horrible rapes in the book. A barmaid who also sold sex (not the herione) was raped twice. She was gang raped the second time. There was no pleasure (no forced seduction here--which I don't like but I know some people do) however, the rape was descibed erotically. And it was not. Also, even after the herione witnessed the rapes of this woman and the woman was telling the truth about something she was doing, the heroine called her a whore. This was out of character and not to mention awful.The makings of a book book and a good writer are in here. I risked another book and the writer improves greatly but I can't recommend this book.",1,0

She was miserable, and had pulled away from everyone she was close to with the exception of her best childhood friend Todd.  He wouldn't let her, and practically had to force her to get out and live again.

When the past threatened her future, she wasn't sure she would have the opportunity to find out what was possible with Caleb.This was tragic heart wrenching story with love, laughter, and passion.

"It's hard to write a review of this book.  It was engaging, creative, full of action, and relatively memorable.  Well worth the kindle pricing.Yes, it's fantasy....a sort of dark version of the standard kid grows up and learns how to fight battles and perform sorcery, but it was also deeper than that and more honest/humble/simple.Perhaps, the best summary was that this book could have formed the basis of an amazingly good story, but it does go by fast and to truly appreciate character development...there would need to be much more.The writing was in the background...one hardly noticed it was there.  Perhaps another years worth of editing and reviews and it would have easily made 4 stars for me...as it is I'm trying to avoid givingtoo many 4 stars to many great books out these days, and I rarely give 5, so while this is probably a 3.8...I'm putting in 3 on the amazon meter.Either way, for the price.....an easy choice to buy and well worth the time.",3,1
"Author Steve Peek has managed to straddle two worlds, bring his characters through the veils that separate them and still maintain a shroud of mystery around his tale, Longclaws. Are they from the realm we refer to as Hell? Are they behind the legends of the vampire? Are they going to cause me to sleep with the lights on for a while?Longclaws are predators with super-human strength, speed and bravery in their world, where survival is a constant battle. Each member of the clan has an important role to play, vital to their survival, yet, we do not meet them as individuals because that seems unimportant, they are what and who they are, able to see the big picture in the battle for survival, fiercely loyal to their clan and their traditions. When one Leader finds a way to cross the veils that surround their world from ours, it is to survive. Humans are unknown demons to them, weak, yet with the will to survive that is respected by the longclaws. If not for their passing through these veils or ley lines a young boy would never know how to belong to a family, how to feel loved, or how to find self-respect. I wondered if there was a villain in this tale. I saw factions fighting for survival in the only way they knew how!Steve Peek's writing style is almost dreamlike, blending Indian folklore, ley lines, myths and legends into a tale that will stay with you, in a hauntingly beautiful way. He grounds his tale with humanity at its finest, everyday people coping with the impossible, often mirroring the clan's will for survival, but who will win in the end?On a personal note, I absolutely loved the writing, the plot, the characters, the style, the pace and the world-building....my anticipated nightmares, not so much.",5,1

"I thought this book wasted so much time up to 55% of it to give a year by year run down from 1999 until preset on Adam and Ronan. Adam actually listened to Ronan getting it on with various women while he became Ronan's roommate. Unrequited love is one thing, but I cannot believe that Adam never had a relationship with anyone while Ronan was getting it on with every female he could. I was flabbergasted that the two partners at a security firm had not noticed that Adam never dated anyone and no one thought that was weird that Adam never showed interest, unless Ronan asked him for a double date favor. He moved in with Ronan at 18and someone should have figured it out that he was gay since that is their job to notice something that does not add up. Ronan would not have been seen the scene with Kasey and be oh hey i wanna do you.

This story has been told before-- two people who are interested in one another are ""trapped"" together by circumstances-- giving them a chance to explore their attraction. That premise is a yawn- but then again, you don't want the story to get in the way of the porn-- oops, I mean, the romance that is the real reason behind the story. I suggest this story was more porn than romance because the love scene totally lacks finesse. But then again, maybe finesse comes with a price-- and this story was free.",2,0

The Viola in this story is more of a ""typical teenager"" than she is in the books -- all she did was whine, mope about, not appreciate what her parents and others did for her, and whine. Did I mention whine? Because she sure did whine.Maybe younger folks are interested in reading about characters like that, but older ones might want to skip this (even though it's free).It is a YA book/story, so I'm not blaming Ness for making her a realistic teenager, I'm just saying that as an adult, it was no fun at all to read.",1,0

It took me all of 20 minutes to read it, add five for trying to figure out what she meant in sentences containing the improper usage of words (like people who try to use big words to sound smart but you can tell they don't really know or understand the meaning of them). A lot of typographical errors for a short story. Ok I don't want to sound like a prude because I'm not, but that kind of thing really bothers me, it's distracting when I'm reading, don't judge me I can't help it.As for the story, it had potential but it was very nondescript. A thesaurus would help her tremendously. The characters were baseless, there was no real info on them other than a physical description more so of Isabella then Donovan, and very very little background.It's a free, quick read, but sorely lacking in any depth at all. I say it doesn't hurt to check it out for yourself as long as you don't have to pay for it and you're looking for a quickie. Two stars just because the plot was original.

HOWEVER I wish the author's little snippet had actually disclosed what was in this book! When the book starts it is a very sweet love story but then changes to become much &#34;darker.&#34; Yes it is clean as in no sex but zombies, a sorceress and crystals are very present. SO be warned! If you do not like mixing Christianity with zombies etc you will not enjoy this book. If you do, then chances are you will enjoy this book.In writing this review, I kept my personal opinions to myself so that I could describe the quality of the writing and let others know some of what the contents contained. This way you can make an informed decision on whether you want to read it or not. Hope it helps :)",3,1
This book was a total disappointment. It basically went like this :Girl allows everybody at work and home to walk all over her. Girl thinks new boss hates her. She finds out her cousin is sleeping with her boyfriend in girl's own house and bed. Girls goes to work and crys to boss.Boss takes girl to his house and they have sex. Girls stays at boss's house that weekend for more sex.Boss and girl continue to have sex until they say they love each other. The end.Oh and in 1 page or 2 girl gets counseling and backbone. The end.I didnt feel the connection and I couldnt figure out when they fell in love.I mean really ....is it too much to ask for a story in between the erotic sections??,2,0

"PLOT: Hospital cafeteria worker Zandrea first bumps into Brant in the ER. He's injured and bleeding but he leaves without receiving treatment. She sees him soon after at a club and his injuries are healed. Brant overhears her discussing him with her friends. He approaches her with the intentions of having his brother erase her memories of him. But something about her calls to his nature and the evening does not go exactly as he planned. He knows that he cannot be without her.PROS: The author weaves a good plot. The love scenes between Zan and Brant are hot.CONS: The character development could be better. We know very little about Zan and Brant. Zan came off as only being immature. When she met Brant, she was hanging out in the ER for a chance to meet a doctor. That's just wrong.Much of the middle of the book they spend separated since Zan has forgotten him. So at the end when they get their ""happy ever after,"" it's not so believable that she loves him and vice versa.It's a minor issue but it speaks to the plausibility of the plot; Zan never actually see's Brant's injury. She sees blood seeping through his shirt. Since she doesn't know how serious his injury was, there's no reason for her to question it and no reason for him to go after her.3 STARS: I gave it three stars since it is an interesting start to a series. It has peaked my interest enough that I'd like to finish the trilogy.",3,1

"I keep buying these books. The last one(sweeter than wine) was a vast improvement. There was a story line! There was character development!! Finally one of the books has some meat!!! I was excited for the next installment! Then I read it.......and it fell flatter than a fifth graders training bra. Especially when I finished it in about 45 min. And we skip about 2 years. And we go from I love you, to vows, to babies, to a year later...in about 20 pages....c'mon bianca, youre better than this.",1,0

"Sex Idol Shelley Munro.ARC provided via Netgalley.With all the reality shows that currently dominate TV ( and they're the reason I spend so much time reading and don't watch TV) I thought this sounded fun. I get the impression from many of the current programmes that what they really want is to push the sex angle as far as they can without getting banned or reprimanded, so this seemed like something possible at some time in the future. Though I think current TV is dire, this would really kill it for may of us who want programmes designed for those who think and use imagination and don't need to be spoon fed :)Still, the book. Well, as I said I thought this would be fun. A bit of sexy, spicy, erotica wrapped up in an interesting story. Sadly I was wrong, and what this consists of in my opinion is simply page after page after page of sex, self pleasure, with a partner or with multiple partners, with a flimsy, feeble story as an excuse for carrying it. The plot is thin, really poorly put together, (for instance landlords of commercial properties don't call round for a cheque days after a rent rise...it's all BACS transactions..) with the sex part being so repetitive its actually a turn off. I ended up skim reading pages just to see what happened, and get to the end. It certainly wasn't erotic for me :( Its sad really because I think its a novel idea, and could have been really fun and erotic if done in a different way.If you really like this sort of thing you'll find the price of 1.01 for 230 pages/369kb a bargain but for me...no - quickly deleted from my kindle.Stars: sorry but just one.",1,0

"I would rate this 0 starts if possible.I had such high hopes for this book! i was excited to read it...The first chapter was good, it pulled you in immediately, but It was boring by the second chapter. I kept  hoping for it to pick up, provide some kind of information, get thick into the plot, or even let you get to know a character. half way through the book there was STILL  NOTHING. A Half of a book of bantering with the ex-wife and psycho brother in law. The son is supposed to be a suspect but yet he wasn't an active character. He said only a handful of things.  The actions of these characters  were far fetched, unrealistic, and ridiculous. Nothing was revealed, there were no suspects to get to know in order to play the ""who dunnit"" guessing game. The characters were unlikable, what you knew of them anyway, and scarce. I almost put the book down, but I decided to plug along since I had wanted to read it so badly when I bought it. At 51% was when I finally learned the first relevant piece of info. At 55% was finally a description of what Raine looked like. Out of 43 chapters, only 5 of them would have been sufficient to tell the same story.",1,0

I found it, read reviews, downloaded it, read it, finished it in a 20 minute train ride.Other than that, despite the cheesy plot line, I was enjoying it. A little fuzzy on the details since I had not read the original book, but still a good read. I've seen many a romance novel that's more risque that this one.",2,0

"I was surprised to find that this book gives a really realistic look at homosexuality in Regency England. The sex scenes are steamy as hell, but it dealt with perceptions and propriety as well. My only complaint was that it was too short... however, there is a novella that follows this book, which is just as good.Recommended? Absolutely.However, if homosexuality is not your bag, then this is not the book for you.",4,1
"This has potential to be an interesting book, but not as it now stands. The book has purportedly been ""edited"" since the original self-publication date so I assume I was reading the ""improved"" version. The story premise is of a dystopean world divded into the Citizen's Haven where the privileged reign supreme and a slum-like underworld where the unwanted live in the shadows and risk being turned into lobotomized slaves by the Citizens. The author had me from the word dystopia, but syntax errors and awkward, juvenile word choices really took away most of the pleasure of reading it. I'm thankful that the majority of typos referred to in previous reviews were cleaned up or I couldn't have gotten to the end. Still, it was slow going. There are some interesting ideas in the book. I enjoyed the suspense around the character Jeffrey and cared what happened to him. I would have liked Kaylee better had she not been so one-dimensional. Her character lacked subtlety and substance. I found Jeffrey and Michaels and maybe Malcolm to be the only characters who showed some realistic complexity and thus earned my interest. I wanted to care about Kaylee as there was ample opportunity in the frightening and gritty circumstances she found herself in to really make me care, but the lack of development of her character had me rolling my eyes at times. She was too reactive, a cardboard cut-out of a tough young girl survivor, lacking a level of tenderness or vulnerability or emotionl substance that would have made her likeable or even believeable.  Most of the other characters need some work, too, to give them some dimension and the storyline more credibility.  I imagine I would have enjoyed this book had the author hired a professional editor to really edit the issues of syntax and to provide guidance in fleshing out the characters..  For the author: It would really help your English-speaking readers enjoy your written word if you would invest in a real editor. Great as a first draft; a bit tedious as a finished product.",3,1

Ok the first review with a two star rating had nothing to do with the story so let me tell you why I am giving this book a two star rating. First there isnt enough of a character development for me. Also the usage of sighs and giggls along with the word methinks got annoying. The characters were always sighing for this or sighing for that; it was in every chapter as well as giggling at the wrong moments and methinks were used way too much. Also as that reason sounded a little bit redundant so did some of the story when the characters would explain something they sometimes do it twice but worded it slightly different as if the authors forgot they already had it in the story causing the story to drag. Also the actions of the characters didn't make since to me either.....spoil alert.... the parents of the heroine jump to conclusions and don't believe her when she had been forced upon by her cousins intended calling her a whore.  Also she is seen unchaperoned by multiple people with the hero when they were hiding their relationship where I might add there was no romance development... anyways she was seen and even recognized by the king himself but never becomes ruined even when her father finds out. Instead he beats her in the street for all to see and apologizes later in the story like he isn't a bad guy and she accepts his apology!!!! Oh and when they run off to elope it takes a while for it to happen instead of eloping right away?? There were just way too many issues with this book for me. I don't recommend it.,2,0

"After thoroughly enjoying the first book in the Travers Brothers series I ordered the rest of the series.  I think I made a big mistake.The second book in the series is not nearly as good as the first.  Instead of letting the story unfold, the author presents all of the background and most of the plot line in the first chapter.  It&#8217;s too bad because the basic premise of the book is pretty good - Clint Travers has loved Abby, his neighbor and best friend, since they were teenagers but were kept apart by her father, years later she returns home for her father&#8217;s funeral, engaged to another man, and Clint is determine to win her back.  Unfortunately there really isn't much story left to tell after the first chapter, the rest is predictable cheap romance novel fare.While the book is not so bad as to be rated 2 stars, it is not nearly as endearing or as interesting as the previous book.",3,1

Her plans for revenge is thwarted when she runs into her old flame. little did she know that he is one of them...There was too little of everything. Too little plot, too little character development, etc. horribly rushed, but, one has to be mindful that this is a short story from the Mammoth Book of Vampire Romance.  Given the inherent limitation of word space, I suppose it's quite a light fluff to read. You're better off investing in a full length novel of the author to be able to see her full capabilities.",3,1
"The most important question I have when looking at the mix of reviews for this Kindle freebie is this: Did we all read the same book?? It's good for everyone to have their own opinion, but facts are facts, and classifying this as an all-sex-no-plot book is quite inaccurate. The first sex scene doesn't even occur until the 50% mark (on Kindle) and there are only three sex scenes that are described at all, one of which is mostly glossed over. It bothers me when a book is trashed by reviews that incorrectly represent the published material. Is Forbidden: The Sacrifice perfect? No. In my opinion it's quite good (I'll clarify in a moment), but in no way - and this is not opinion - is it a sex-filled smut book with no plot.At thirty-five, Doctor Wesley Atherton is a successful psychiatrist living and working a comfortable, steady life in London. Katherine is a twenty-four year old American who is staying with a family friend in London during her fashion internship when Wes, rather literally, first bumps into her on the Tube. Practical to the point of having been mortally embarrassed by his bohemian parents, Wes had never believed in love at first sight (or second or third sight, actually). He had, however, always firmly believed in recognizing what he wanted in life and working to get it, so when he gets his first glimpse of Katherine's beautiful green eyes and sees that almost precocious smile, Wes does everything humanly possible to convince her that sharing a life with him is what she needs to do - and even though Katherine is engaged to another, Wes is determined to woo her.One evening, following an outing that Wes certainly considers a date, even if Katherine doesn't, their Tube ride comes to a crashing, deadly end, and Wes and Katherine are thrust into Death's awareness - and he's none too happy to have a victim escape his clutches. With the help of a psychic, a spy, and a butler, Wes and Katherine have to embrace a world far more complex and dangerous than they'd previously believed, and hope that the bonds of love that are so new but so deep between them will be enough to save them all.Forbidden: The Sacrifice is actually a nifty little story with a quirky cast of characters and a plot that moves along nicely, once it starts moving. I was totally enamored with Wes and thought he made an excellent protagonist. It's actually been awhile since I've read a book I'd classify as paranormal romance-ish with a male lead and told in first person POV, so if he hadn't been so appealing, amusing, witty, and self-deprecating, this book really could've gone bad for me fast. Fortunately, he was all those things, as well as determined, intelligent, charming, and very much committed to his Katherine. I liked him very much.Unfortunately, and as is often the case with first person POV, the rest of the characters weren't fleshed out as well as they could have been, though I don't really have any major complaints about the level of development in the secondary characters Jennifer, Will, and Charles. The POV just makes it too hard to develop secondary characters fully. At least the history between Wes and Charles and the professional relationship between Wes and Jennifer helped define and flesh out their characters enough to work in the story (Charles in particular). The only real complaint I had with character development was, unfortunately, Katherine. As the female lead, I would've liked to have seen quite a bit more development and dimension given to her personality and what was there was not always appealing. She was a bit too wishy-washy for me - insecure, afraid, and doubting one minute, determined, strong, and certain the next, with no clear rhyme or reason in the vacillation, and she was never written as a fight-by-his-side sort of female. She was pushed into rooms and hidden behind doors. Protected. I can understand Wes' need to do that, but I'm a bit too much of a feminist to accept Katherine's willingness to allow it. That IS personal opinion and preference, though, and others may not feel the same.I liked the plot and I loved that it was centered in London. I had a few issues with the pacing, though, and a minor complaint about the opening chapters. The story starts with an out of sequence event, the Tube crash, and because of the nature of the crash, the narrative (Wes' perspective) is disjointed and choppy - confused and wounded. While it's completely understandable that it would be that way given what's just happened to him and to Katherine, because we don't know either of them yet, it's a little jarring and takes a bit of perseverance to wade through with any sense of feeling for these characters we've just met. I wish the story had been told in a more linear fashion starting with the meeting of the lead characters, so that when the crash occurred, we had a baseline understanding of Wes in particular and some empathy for his fear about Katherine's plight.Perseverance, however, does pay off in this instance, and once the story pushes beyond the crash the plot really starts to zing along and Wes turns out to be vastly entertaining as he tells his story. The paranormal aspects of the book are slowly added until the intensity and danger reaches a tense fruition. Again, I have another personal opinion/preference. I wish those paranormal aspects had started to sneak in a bit sooner and built a bit faster. I don't think the plot was slow, but I do think that the pacing could've been improved by spending less time with Wes being oblivious and doubtful of the mounting paranormal events around him and more time on the climax to the story, which I personally thought felt a wee bit rushed and a bit confusing for that rush. As a result, I thought the climax was a little less powerful and lacked the impact it could've had, given the gravity of the thing.Circling back around to the sex topic, I feel the need to elucidate my opinion. While the sex scenes weren't overabundant in this book, I will admit, the sex is described graphically. Wes uses adult language and isn't real into flowery euphemisms. In fact, he uses colorful, sometimes coarse language all through the book, and while most is British slang, if you're up on the slang from across the pond, you'll know just how colorful and coarse it is. In my opinion, however - and this is very important to me - the sex scenes develop as a natural, healthy progression of the emotional situation the characters are in at the time, as opposed to gratuitous sex for no other reason than to titillate readers. Hey, I'm all for a bit of fun titillation, but I like to leave the gratuitous kind for when I'm in the mood for erotica romance. This isn't that. I found the sex to be neither overly explicit nor overdone. Take that as you will, as I admit I prefer the sex scenes in my books to be as adult and freely passionate as I prefer sex to be.For a free read, this book is far more than I expected. Considering some of the other ratings and reviews, it's WAY better than I'd hoped. As the start of a paranormal romance series, it definitely has potential and has insured that I will be actually paying for the second book in the series. This was the first book I'd read by Samantha Sommersby. It won't be the last.",4,1

"For the first time in my extremely long erotic reading life, I had to skip the menage sex scenes in a book. Which really was bad since it was the main reason I chose it. I prefer my menages to have the m/m be involved with each other, so this story seemed to be perfect to me when I read the blurb. But goodness me, the scenes read like really bad cyber sex interactions. The sentences seemed to not flow together, which took me right out of the sex scene. That should not happen when sex is involved.The story itself was good, which is why I kept reading, but this writer had a hard time when it came to the characters voices, especially when they were speaking to each other.The word please was used so much that my kindle froze as I was trying to keep track of the number of times it came out of the mouth of the heroine.Also, please lose the amount of !!!! (exclamation points) that for some odd reason was put at the end of almost every utterance leading up to and during the sex scenes.I really would like more stories starring these three, but not until the writer gets a thesaurus and some more experience in writing about sex.",2,0

Rebecca is determined to let her hair down (so to speak) and cut loose in this wild west town ( held in check by a Sheriff *ADAM*that has somewhat of a reputation of shoot first ask questions later)...HIs deputy Will is newly married to Eliza Jane and is constantly running off to be with her so Adam figures it's time for him to maybe take a nice sweet wife like Rebeccca.

Dare she ask Adam to be her first??...........Of  course Adam doesn't like her revealing clothes or the face paint-especially not the looks she gets from the men! When she asks everyone to call her Miss Becky he about comes unglued. Well, it seems our 'Miss Becky"" has a good reason to be incognito,(the suspense) and between the bible brigade, Eliza's liberated women and Adam's bumbling courtship, oh, and Will's bubble baths with his wife........this story actually has a lot of story(if you know what I mean) I was never bored and the laughs, tears and oohs and ahhhs made this a very enjoyable book for me. The romance rates high in this one....and the sex is sweet, never overdone nor smutty. Yes, the 'other side' of this dangerous sheriff .........is......""sigh""......and tha't's sooo sexy.Great Job!

I can't stand women who act like 14 year olds, but my biggest pet peeve of them all is a writer who can not write a teenager so they make them smart mouth hateful brats {most teenagers are not like this and it ticks me off that people write them like this}. Were I drew the line and said no more this book isn't worth my time, is when she made a vulgar remark about her teenaged daughter.

We have been told in previous books the were men are all ""alphas"" in their own ways, even if they aren't alphas in their pack. The actions of the Hero and his father were anything but alpha through most of the book, it seemed at the end, they both pulled their heads out of their butts and got it together. On the Heroine's side of the story, I got the tri-bond issue, I understand it and it was depicted well in this book. I didn't like the fact her own sister didn't try to comfort the heroine while the jealousy and other issues were brought up. It seemed the sister took the side of the Hero's way too much. All in all it was an okay read for me, too much angst in this book. Definitely not a re-read for me.",3,1

"This is the third story I've read by the author848 (Dark Bites)andLike Cats and Dogs (Dark Bites)are the other two).  Ropars seems to have a clear respect for the history of horror, which should translate into a passion for the genre.  None of that passion, however, makes it into the story.A young woman, Crow Lee, is awoken from a bizarre dream by a sudden sound.  At first she thinks the sound is an earthquake, then she thinks it is a plane crash.  As she logs on to her social networking sites and turns on the news, the truth turns out to be something even more unsettling -- a meteor has struck downtown Chicago and it is having a strange effect on dead bodies.  Crow finds herself having to fight her away out of her high rise apartment building with only the weapons she has on hand.Ropars states that his intention was to place strong women in classic horror situations.  The problem with this story is that the situation was a little too classic -- Crow is surrounded by stock 1960s-style zombies, right down to their muttered pleas for ""brainsssss.""  I wish he had put a bit more of his creative energy into the scenes -- some innovation would have gone a long way.Fans of strong female characters who don't mind a standard situation will still find a lot to enjoy in this story.  It eliminates some of the problems with pacing and appropriate level of detail that I found in the other two stories in the series.",2,0
"I got the Kindle freebie which was suppose to be ""scintillating samples.""  What a disapointment!  Okay there were several pages of written words but nothing to entice me into wanting more.

"I ""bought"" this quickly and didn't realize it was a romance so I was taken aback at first by the language. This could have been interesting if it were longer. It felt like an abridged version of a longer story. Reading reviews now and finding it's a prequel novella to a trilogy makes sense but it wasn't enough to get me interested in the trilogy. It's like the author rushed this out b/c her editor told her to.",3,1
"Old style Christian romance, with more focus on the Christian life and conversion than the romance. A bit implausible, but still enjoyable for the nostalgic.",4,1

"I don't normally like these kinds of vigilante books but I was charmed by the writing, dialogue and humor. It's clear early on in his career that he knew what he was doing, and how to create compelling, even funny characters. I'm loving the 80s pop culture references. (Sassoon jeans!) If it were another author, I probably would not continue reading the series, but I'm a determined Goldberg completist, so I'm looking forward to seeing how the series turns out.",3,1
"I'm not a fan of scary, horror-filled books, but this one, filled with humor and wit and action, may make me change my mind.  It certainly made me a fan of the author (I just bought his other book).One thing I admire most of all:  this story was clearly a novella-sized idea, and the author did not try to pad it out into a 300-page novel, as so many authors do, thereby producing a bloated whale.  He let it run the length it should be, and the result is a very nice, tight, ingenious story.None of the characters is a stereotype; not one scene is over-the-top hystrionics.  Good solid, vivid writing.  I loved it.P.S.  I found three errors.  ""Reigns"" for ""reins""; ""Jefrey and I"" when it should have been ""Jefrey and me"" (location 825): and it's spelled ""lightning"", not ""lightening"".  Dear author:  please fix.",4,1

"Again with the BDSM. Not much of a story. Characters cartoonish. The only reason for writing this dreck is to show how a woman should be punished during sex, and the 17 year old virgin is supposed to like it!

If you like books that describe sex as a violation, then you will like this.",1,0
"Joe has a job that requires him to travel a lot, but he also has his old family home that needs attention while he is away: the solution is to hire a house sitter. Tess is desperate for a change and an escape, so when she sees the ad for a house sitter she makes a call and throws all her belongings in her beat-up car and drives 6 hours even though he didn't really offer the job and she did kinda accept it. Now Joe has a house sitter with a small child filling his home and changing everything around him. When did life get so complicated?First off, this story was a great story. There was great character development, great analogies, and great romance. If everything was so ""great"" why am I only giving it 3 stars? Well, a few reasons really.Firstly, everything was so drawn out. Yes, it did help with the grounding of the characters and the changes in their emotions, but oh it just took forever for anything to ever happen.  It kinda sapped any enjoyment I had out of the story because EVERYTHING took too long. I felt like I was reading a 900 page book.Secondly, the book was written in a ""stream of conscience"" type of way where we are privy to the characters (and I mean ALL the characters) complete thought process. I'm not a big fan of this type of narrative. This is completely personal and subjective, but there you go. This narrative style also lead to the feeling of everything being drawn out.Thirdly, I had a few issues with Joe. He is a 44 year-old man who builds bridges for a living, which requires him to travel and work from different locations all the time. But, he has a woman stashed in each city. Now, these women aren't ""kept"" by him, nor do they expect commitment from him, but he shacks up with them whenever he is in their town. Now, it's not really this I had a problem with. The problem I had was that once he got into Tess' bed, he kept up with this behavior. He even talked to himself that he was a creature of habit, which is why he's now shagging another lady he has no real interest in; but Tess better not be talking to that Seb guy who came around last week asking for her. Nope, he can get his jollies off with some skank in France but she better be keeping house. Okay, so it wasn't really as bad as that, but it really rubbed me the wrong way. It smacked me of betrayal, of cheating, and of deceit--Especially because he made it seem, led Tess to believe, that all the other woman were no longer a concern...yet he goes a whoring as soon as he's gone.Usually, I'm not one for romance stories involving single parents of young children. I'm not sure why. However, Ms. Freya did such a great job in including little Miss Emmaline that she didn't detract or derail the story or romance.  Also, I loved how Tess had her friends and interests and helped define her.SECRETS was a nice contemporary chick-lit romance about how secrets can affect how you perceive life and keep true relationships from forming. A lot of bridge analogies were used, as Joe loves and builds bridges. This story is about the bridge Joe and Tess build to span their lives into a solid relationship together.",3,1
"As an author myself, I sincerely resent tr nowry for causing me to lose valuable writing time - this series is compelling, addictive, unique, technically brilliant and has ruined any chance I have of meeting my own deadline. I MUST read every damned word.Brilliant character development, terrifyingly plausible premise - if you are a fan of any of the classic Sci-Fi writers from the 1930's to the present, you owe it to yourself to read these.Thank you - I have enjoyed every word.",5,1

"Zsadist and Bella's story from the Black Dagger Brotherhood really did rate this novellete. I very much enjoyed it, and am sad to have read that, for me, Ward's story just seemed to degenerate after the 4th book.

"I love Gothic Romances, especially paranormal ones, and not many are published anymore. So I was delighted to discover Touch Me in the Dark and read it with great pleasure. A spooky old Victorian, interesting characters, and a twisty story. For a different take, this story was set in an unusual place--Southern California--not where you'd expect to find a Gothic ghost story. But it works! Touch Me in the Dark is definitely worth reading!",5,1

I enjoyed the characters but I really wish I could have heard Brett' s side from him.

"What a fabulous Undone!! I loved it! Knowing this short story is a delicious appetizer for The Diamonds of Welbourne Manor by Diane Gaston, Amanda McCabe, and Deb Marlowe made it even better. There's more!From the moment I met Margaret Lewis I was cheering for her, and I fell in love with Captain Graham Veall before he walked onto the page. My heart broke for Graham, and yet Margaret was simply perfect for him. And I just about burst into tears at the end. This is why I love romance stories. *wild applause*",5,1
"I have downloaded this ebook a while back along with many others. Just now got to reading it. I just could not wrap my head around the first few pages! I love to read all types of stories, however this one confuses me from the start. The first person viewpoint is even more confusing. Hard for me to keep track on which is speaking and where it ends. I wouldn't mind a little bit more detail and especially the thrills except- there is only a crumble to none at all. I would have loved the author to make some changes, add some more descriptive and help us &#8211; the readers- identify who is actually talking and when. Also to show if it is a thought and not continued conversation &#8211; which if I had the actual book in hand- want to throw it to the wall.Linda caught cheating &#8211; then dies but is not &#8211; but the conversation &#8211; ugghhh so irritating to read from the get go. Once I am irritated- that is it.Overall, if you are the type of person who is rushed and loves to confuse everyone &#8211; then this one is for you. However, if you love a good story- I would have to suggest to pass this one up until the author re-edits this book to be more readable.",1,0

"This was my first book by this author so I was lost on some of the background of the character's, since this is part of a series.  Had a lot of action, and I felt for the character's.  But, this book is way to short to be charging for $2.00 for.  (ljb)",3,1
"First book in Wicked  series, followed byWicked Bad: Wicked, Book 2.Plot:Young female Magians (witches) are being killed. For some reason the only person who can help is ""human"" Callie. She has to go undercover, with two beaus, to smoke out the murderer. Only Tucker and Tyghe are not exactly uninterested in Callie, Callie isn't exactly un-magical and the Bad Guy is not someone anyone would have expected.Comments:- A short book (1488 kindle locations) but a complete story. Although it is the first in a series, the plot was completed, no hanging plot-threads as such.- The end of this book comes upon us very quickly. All this build up to find the murderer and *bam* it's over. Very disappointing. Yes, I like how it all came out, I like the HEA, I like who Callie becomes, but for all the long-winded clothes shopping and angst over placing Callie in such danger, the lack of action/danger/suspense is seriously disappointing- Sex is m/f (with possibility of being caught) and m/f/m. There are handcuffs and ""rough"" play (but no violence). The goal is a committed m/f/m relationship, and the males are brothers so no m/m. The sex is HOT and (mostly) loving. The three are forced together by fate/destiny so with that we get the ""is this really who we want/what we want"" angst. It makes the sex at times ""unwanted"", ""I'm only here, I only lust for you, because we have no choice"". A bit primal and feral. In the end, they come together with love as well as desire (how else do they get their HEA?) but it takes a few practice runs.- Callie should be an amazingly strong, interesting character. Instead she seems to have her fabulous traits ignored. Annoying.Opinion:So much possibility. What a shame it couldn't be seen through to the end. Loved the beginning. Loved the idea of loving Tucker and distant Tyghe being part of the Triune. Hated the reason Callie was left in an (apparently) abusive home, that Tyghe who treated her as a nothing her whole life was ""forgiven"", that presumably Moira knew all of this and did nothing, that this ""human"" was the only one to go undercover (if it had been Tucker's idea, as a cop, okay, but it wasn't), that Mitchell was pretty much ignored. Maybe there is more in the later books, but it does not appear so. If this is the sum and total of Callie's story I am very disappointed. After finishing this book I don't remember the wicked sex, the loving bonds, the exciting finale; I remember a character I wanted to know more about, who's story was half told. Definitely could have been better.",3,1

"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and the World literature is even more filled with beautiful, unusual and imaginative stories.This collection of the Indian fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain Indian cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and talking animals are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""long, long, time ago."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike.",5,1
I have read several books from this author I've found that her books are either love it or hate it.I'm glad to say that I really liked this one.Troy is definitely Alpha but not overdone with it. He has his own issues about marriage and relationships( he's not ready for either)  and that certainly plays a part in the story.Angie is a plus sized chick who took an orgy cruise to nowhere with her friend in hopes to get laid. She's very insecure about her weight and even more so when she notices that she's most likely the only oversize woman on the cruise.Both are suprised by their attraction for each other but for different reasons.All in all I think this story was pretty well written. There was an actual story in between the sex scenes ....which are super hot by the way.My only issue was how much Angie refered to her weight. I know she had issues with her size but she was so obsessed about it I started to get a little irritated with her.,4,1

I totally recommend this amazing read, but make sure you are somewhere where you won't get strange looks for laughing out loud.  I'm off to read the next one.  What a delightful series!",5,1

I loved the story but the story itself is not even close to the page count of 291. Not even if you add in all the pages of exerpts. The price of $2.10 is way too much for such a short story for me. Returned for a refund based strictly for that reason.,3,1
"These stories were just not on a par with the original, TWILIGHT PHANTASIES, and I was so disappointed.  Now this is just my take on this.  Maggie Shayne is a good writer and these could possibly be right down your alley.  I am merely stating that I was so excited to read all of her series but the first book was the best to me.  Her vampires do not possess all the traits of other vampire characters I have read - they don't have as many skills.  Also, they think they are so wonderful they are constantly putting themselves in harms way as though they are not all that bright.  Just off somehow.",2,0
"I've read longer works by Ms. James, and found them unmemorable.  Novels take more skill than might appear--developing characters the reader can like or dislike, or in some way find interesting enough to continue turning the page. As I recall, she doesn't particularly excell in the long form. I gave this work a try, hopinng Eloisa James's forte might be in the shorter work.  While it is difficult to develop characters much in the time and space contraints of the novella, one would hope for interesting characters, at least.  Ms. James has fallen to the temptation of crafting paper doll characters: all rather shallow and incredible extremes.  The husband is rough and evil, but not entirely so.  His successor is suave and courteous, but not particularly so.  The protagonist (there are actually two and a half) is a man who apparently has grown and changed very little from boy to man, yet we are supposed to root for him.  The heroine has changed not at all from girl to wife to widow.  She is simply confused and lustful.  Sorry to 'spoil' the plot for you, but read it yourself and see if you find it any more satisfying.",2,0

"This author shows some promise but has a ways to go.  First of all, bottom line one should do a better job of proofing.  There were numerous typos as well as grammatical errors.  I will give some latitude for the grammar as I am going to assume that this person does not speak English as a first language.  The storyline kept me going, although it should have been cut.  It was much too long-winded in parts, which led me to skip over passages.  I think if this author keeps at it they will improve over time so I can only give this effort 2 stars",2,0
"This book (and Book 1) was a bit too Janet and John for me.  ""Are you sitting comfortably"", ""Once upon a time"", ""...and they all lived happily ever after"".

"****Spoiler alert**** I don't really give things away, but some might consider what I say spoilers, so fair warning. I was looking forward to this book mainly because I usually love Maya Banks's style. But I found myself having to push through parts of the story. The plot sounded good, different, and it was. However, there was no real angst. The story, by design, starts out in the middle of the relationship. She does explain what led up to this point, however, the men never show their &#34;alpha-ness&#34; in any true sense and she just capitulates to them way to easily. None of them seem to have any friends or family as well. If she was so unhappy and lonely, why didn't she talk to them? Why is it only the three of them? The only other character mentioned is the men's personal assistant who seems to be on her side. But she doesn't confide in her either. Also, it is mentioned in the very beginning that one of the characters may not be happy with the arrangement and that line is quickly dropped, never to be mentioned again. I normally would highly recommend anything by this author but I don't feel I can with this one. It seems to be lacking something that usually makes Maya's books quick reads.",2,0
"I was going to send a message to the author and tell him I just can't review this book. Then, I went and read the reviews at Goodreads and Amazon (etc.) and I decided some balance was required. Whenever I read a book like this and I read reviews that are not only positive, but have praise specifically for the very things I find worst about the book - I always wonder if they're friends of the author, alternate identities of the author, or people with really low standards in their reading selection.I was 10% into this book and struggling to read further. I made it as far as 27% when I gave up. I just can't force myself to read something this awful. And while I'd really like to get to the surprise ending the other readers have hinted at, I just can't force myself to read any further to get to the big reveal.My first problem is the characters. They're like cartoon characters, the women more than the men. They simply aren't believable. I didn't like any of them and I couldn't relate to any of them. I'm all for damaged characters if their damage makes them interesting, but these characters were so cartoonish they were nothing more than tiresome. I also kept asking myself why this story was populated with the details of characters who seemed to have no impact on the story and do nothing to move the story along. It was difficult enough to maintain an interest in the primary cast of characters without getting distracted by the minor, or even unnecessary, characters.Contributing to the inability to relate to the characters is the second major problem: the dialogue. It's stilted and doesn't flow. Even if the author hadn't told me English was not his first language, I would've guessed. The syntax of the entire book is off, but it's most evident in the dialogue. It's difficult (painful, even) to read.The third problem is the setting. I've been to Medford, OR. I have friends who live in Medford, OR. I don't recognize Medford in this story. I have also worked in hospitals and worked with doctors for over 20 years. The hospital setting and situations were not believable to me. At least when ""House, MD"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" wander far from reality, the characters are interesting and what they're doing is interesting. The same is not true in ""Promise Me Eternity."" Every time the author took the doctor on detailed rounds, including a description of the patient and what the patient was doing and the conversation with the patient, I kept wondering ""what the hell does this have to do with the story?"" Unless you're a doctor, rounds are boring. And unless a patient is going to play a part in what's going to happen later in the story, the reader doesn't need to know what they look like, what they're doing in the hospital and what they said to the doctor during rounds. Acknowledging that I didn't finish the book, so I don't know whether or not these patients figure later in the story, I can't imagine that every patient in every round is going to play an important part in the whole story.All in all, I was grateful I didn't pay for this book. Even at $0.99, it's not worth it and it's definitely not worth the time.",1,0
Rhonda is amazing at writing about the characters and making it feel like you are truly them or feeling the same feeling they are. Great read.,5,1
I am usually a big Delilah Devlin fan. I was surprised how much I did not like this particular book. First it is very much a FFM book. Lots of intimate interaction between the 2 women- way more than eluded to in the description. Second the main female character is 17. YES 17! That just skeeved me out. Sorry Delilah this one fell flat...and had a huge yuck factor for me (the teenager). If either of these details would have been more clear in the description I would have never downloaded the book. That being said I will continue to read this author and hope next time the characters are more tolerable.,1,0

This is a short and touching story about a estranged brother at his sister's wedding falling for the groom's father after cruising each other at the hotel where they were staying.

"My biggest complaint would be the typos.  They were frequent enough to interrupt the flow for me at times.  I thought Abraham's character could have been fleshed out more.  He was one-dimensional at best and, considering his age, he could have been much more interesting.  I also would have liked more explanation as to why Thereon chose her.  It was sort of glossed over which isn't very realistic.  For a vampire his age, what he liked in Two he could have liked in many others.  I also noticed a contradiction where Thereon says the name of a character, and then in the next page he claims he doesn't know her name.Other than that, I was pretty engaged until about the last 85-90% where it became extremely slow.  I felt like the plot was stretched out at this point merely to fill pages.  It was a little plot surrounded by a LOT of uninteresting filler.  For that, I downgraded it from 4 stars to 3 stars.  Either way, for a free book, it definitely didn't feel like a waste of time. Things could potentially get really interesting for this trilogy.",3,1

"I have subscribed to this blog for quite a while and have always enjoyed it. It is well worth the .99 per month to have it pushed to your kindle. Mr. Calvin posts in-depth articles about kindle-specific news as well as articles that focus on e-readers more generally and the ebook market at large. The articles are timely and interesting. He writes well and posts very frequently, so the blog updates on an almost daily basis.I especially recommend this blog for those who are new to kindles (any variety) as he includes tips & tricks and will be an invaluable resource for getting the most out of your kindle. It has been more fire-centric since the kindle fire was released, but I have only an e-ink model and still find it very relevant. He also posts freebies fairly frequently, so if you're interested in free kindle downloads this blog will help you find them.Mr. Calvin also regularly examines the prices of ebooks in a relatively scientific fashion and shows very detailed graphs displaying his data before going into some detail describing what he thinks is happening. He keeps up-to-date on everything involving the agency model of book pricing and is also an advocate for accessibility via the text-to-speech function.",4,1

"I really wanted this book to be dreadful, as in ""full of dread"". Instead it was simply unreadable. The dialogue for children of that age was not at all believable, and so many opportunities were missed to generate true suspense. The various plot lines never gelled as a cohesive narrative. Very disappointed.",1,0
"Like the previous reviewer, I understand the point of view this story is told in. Unlike the previous reviewer, I liked it. Normally, I'm not a great fan of the ""tell"" style of writing, but as this story is actually portraying one side of a conversation, it's entirely appropriate.This story does, indeed, chronicle the lifespan of the narrator's breasts, from their sudden emergence to their ""betrayal"". There's a good dose of humour, both black and blue, and I found the emotional content appropriate and touching. The breasts themselves act almost as a character, and the narrator allows them to be both a physical and emotional barrier whenever she feels overwhelmed. The loss of such a big part (literally and metaphorically) of her lifestyle is handled with a cracked bravado that Ms. Brio conveys very well.This story is probably not for everyone, of course. As I said in the title to this review, it's a sweet story from an emotional aspect. But it has a hard edge to its bones. Just the kind of erotica I enjoy the most.",4,1
"A good story really, but yes, the editing, or lack thereof, detracted from it. i enjoyed the chemistry between the characters. Especially after they met up again after the wedding. And I did find it very annoying that he refused to believe her right up until the end. Surely he could tell they weren't gold diggers long before then?! All in all, a good story.",3,1
"Do not waste your time.  I purchased this for my 13 year old and was shocked at how many F-bombs were in it.  I immediately deleted it from my kindle.

"I don't write plot summaries or include spoilers.I really enjoyed reading this book 2 of Ms. Arend's 'Granite Lake Wolves' series, which begins withWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1. Similar to book 1 in that this is a FAST read. Given that, it is pretty satisfying. Good book to read in an afternoon if you just want a little relaxing fun. It would almost be as comforting as a good cup of tea... or is it the other way around?Characters are sweet- more sweet than sexy in this case. Both Missy and Tad come across as people you'd like to have living next door. Despite the fact that I wasn't drooling over them or caught up in their passion, their romance was well done. There was some background between the two which helped provide some depth and their sexual tension was fun to watch unfold. I chuckled in places and sighed in contentment in others.This series does seem a little light on the paranormal side- you don't really get to spend too much time on the shifting or their nature as wolves, but pack politics come into play- and certainly wolf instincts. This book had a bit more magic in it given that the Omega wolf was a key part of the plot.All in all, it's a light, uncomplicated paranormal romance series. Something to read for fun when you have time. It is light and romantic enough to be soothing. I will save the next one for a day when I need a little escape.FURTHER READING: if you like this, you'll like...Moira Rogers' basic werewolf romance series:Cry Sanctuary: Book 1 of Red Rock Pass seriesR.G.

"I have to say Jessica Coulter Smith is doing something right when it comes to shifters and the like. If you have not already done so I suggest you read the prequel of the series called Whispering Lake. These first two books can be read as standalones though. I was hoping to see Cole's story, knowing that he kind of got left holding the bag in the prequel. So a quick recap, Cole is out and about in his wolf form when he stumbles upon Marin an injured battered woman. He calls for help from Cassie (Whispering Lake). Turns out Marin is a mate to one of the super hot brothers (in age order Gabriel, Cole, and Michael; the latter two are twins with different color eyes). Turns out Marin has been abused but is strangely comforted by Cole who adorably stays in wolf form to make her feel more comfortable.This book was given to me for an honest review.First, I want to say that I really appreciated the blending of the prequel with Moonlight Protector it was flawless. Second, the title is aptly named. Cole the lead male in this story is the protector in both human and wolf form. Cole purposely keeps to his wolf form for the comfort of the lead female character Marin who has been kidnapped and abused. Third, the humorous element to this story helps cut the serious nature of the topic. I really felt that the comic relief was pulled off nicely. My favorite scene is when the dirt bag who kidnapped her appears at the family's Victorian home asking for Marin; Cole and Marin come out of his room all over each other pretending that they have been up to no good, while Michael the constant jokester plays with the whole charade in order to protect Marin (the scene is a lot funnier than my lame attempt and summarization).I really enjoyed the twist that if you are a mate then your packs blood can heal you, I found this fascinating from an anthropology standpoint. I wondered if evolution specifically selected for something like that (just an errant thought). There was a great blend of drama, romance, paranormal, and mystery. Once again Mrs. Coulter Smith has transported me into Ashton Grove, Georgia and made me lose track of time. I was so absorbed in the story I missed Lunch! And I love lunch LOL.I recommend adding this book to your reading list and you will not be disappointed.Book Summary:Cole Andrews, biologist by trade and werewolf by blood, is tired of being alone. He and his two brothers live in the large Victorian home that had belonged to their parents. He's always wanted to find his mate and start a family. Now that he's in his thirties, he's starting to give up hope. He's already seen all of the women available in his small town of Ashton Grove and so far none of them are ""the one.""Marin Thomas is fleeing for her life. After being abducted and held hostage, she is determined to escape the maniac once and for all. Stealing his car, she travels as far and as fast as she can - until a car accident lands her in some woods near Ashton Grove, Georgia. Fighting for her very life, she finds herself begging a wolf for help.Is Marin the mate that Cole has been waiting for? Or will she end up with one of his brothers? One sniff tells him that she belongs to his pack. The only question that remains is who will win her heart?",5,1
"No spoilers or summaries.HIGH LEVEL: Quick, erotic read. Short on plot development, but HIGH on the LUST scale. (and we don't read these books for plot, really...) Characters are surprisingly vivid, magic is ethereal, but warm like a summer breeze. Sex is... well, I'll admit I groaned out loud more than once. No real violence, TONS of sex- no BDSM, but multiple partners.I'm a fan of Ms. Arand's ""Granite Lake Wolves"" series and decided to read other books she has out there and I've been pleasantly surprised, though the Wolves are still the better books- sweeter stories, deeper histories, better characters. This book has MUCH hotter sex, though.If you are looking for something to keep you warm at night or make that lonely day at the beach just a little more exciting, this is it.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. R.G.

"Chocolatier Mariah Hughes barely remembers the night of drunken revelry that led to her and her two best friends making wishes as they tied on wish bracelets during their vacation cruise a year ago, let alone what she'd wished for. Fortunately for her, the United Wish Federation keeps exceptional video records, and when her UWF agent shows up to grant her wish, a disbelieving Mariah is given proof even she can't deny.That still doesn't mean she remembers her wish.It's only with her friend's help that her memory is jogged. And when it is, it's hard to believe she'd ever wish for anything else. Six years ago she'd had a magical night with a young guy named I.C. Tucker. It was the best night of her life and Tucker had fueled her hottest fantasies ever since. She would love another chance with the now famous professional poker player.When her newest client turns out to be the soon-to-be-married bride of Tucker's best friend, and Mariah comes face to face with Tucker again after six long years, Mariah realizes two things. One, the man still draws her on every level, and two...her wish has been granted. And Mariah has no intention of letting the opportunity go to waste.Problem is, their connection is so intense and her emotions so quickly involved, that having their entire relationship based on nothing but some silly wish - something with a definitive expiration date - no longer appeals. Mariah wants a happily ever after with the man of her dreams...and hottest fantasies. To get that, though, she'll have to do the one thing that may push Tucker away from her forever.~*~So this is what you get when you take a little magic and a little chocolate, add a dash of humor and a bunch of hot sex, and stir with a surprising depth of emotional connection. Wow!All Inis an erotic PNR novella that thoroughly satisfies.Lately the most consistent issue I've had with the romances I've been reading is that too many are plenty heavy on the lust but not so big on the deeper interpersonal relationships and downright light on love, with entire relationships based solely on the horizontal...or vertical....or upside down, for the kinksters out there...mambo. And I'm not talking about the erotic romances, either. So to actually read an erotic romance that manages to blend the hot sex with a solid romance between two likable characters quite obviously made for each other was a special treat that I won't soon forget.There's plenty of hot sex, sure, but I adored how Willoughby had a plausible backstory for her characters that laid the groundwork for the romance that developed, so it didn't feel unrealistically fast when the relationship start getting emotionally significant for the characters. Mariah and Tucker were wonderfully into each other for more than just physical pleasure, and that romance is as sweet as the chocolate delicacies Mariah sells. It's a great balance.The paranormal elements were fun. Davina was a hoot and she stole every scene she was in. I didn't buy how quickly Mariah wrapped her mind around the whole wish granting thing, though, even with the proof she got (which was awesome in its own right), and I found Tucker's reactions later in the book to be even more of a stretch. Those were minor grievances, however, when compared to the strength of the rest of the story and my appreciation for an erotic romance that gave as much attention to the ""romance"" as it did the ""erotic."" I liked this one a lot.Disclosure: A copy of this novella was provided to me by the author for an honest review. This rating, review, and all included thoughts and comments are my own.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",4,1

"Sean Keller, a top business man, and Chole Walters,computer savvy assistant, meets at a bar in Denver on a business trip. The two ends up having a one night stand both only wanting spicy companionship for the night. At least, that what it was thought to be believed. However, fate finds it's way into the picture. Chloe leaves the next morning planning on never to see Sean again. Chloe stumbling into her work office after a night of wild sex to find that Sean is her new boss! But she has bigger issues at hand ( if that's possible). Someone at the company is stealing millions of dollars and her name is attached to the crime. Finding ways to prove her innocence and to keep clear of that fine hunk of a new boss she just inherited, Chloe must choose between years in prison of a crime she didn't commit or trusting a complete stranger to her clear her name. What you get at the end is a true shocker.If you're looking specifically for a book that is all about the sex and less romance, then this is a good choice. The book holds your interest with having a suspense flare to its plot.However I had problems. One thing that turned me off with the book was how Chloe was such a weak women. For someone trying to clear their name of fraud, she was too timid in my opinion when she needed to be more aggressive. Secondly, I didn't like the fact she let her boss use her sexual as she did because she'd been in a one-night-stand with him. At times, I was screaming for her to speak the hell up! Please! However, I find this to be a reoccurring problem with lots of IR erotica/romance books. The women are very strong sexual but not as strong outside the bedroom their so much or reserved. Would be nice to see less of that.Overall, I still thought the book was a good read and would recommend it.",3,1
"I do not write reviews as often as I should, however, after attempting to read this bundle, I had to review.  I have never read anything that contained more adjectives than these books.  It was absolutely unbearable. I could tell that this author had writing talent.  The story flowed well and made sense.  I found myself scanning more than reading because I couldn't deal with the overly flowery writing style.  If that type of writing is not your style, you will want to skip these books.  Following is a small example of the nonstop adjective use in these books...A bitter mountain breeze wrapped around his long frame, whipping his shaggy hair against the furrowed ridges of his brow as Jeremy Burns hiked through the Maryland forest. Like a wrathful banshee, the relentless autumn winds howled with fury, while his fellow Bloodrunner, Cian Hennessey, quietly kept pace at his side.arrrggghhhAfter reading authors like JR Ward, this type of stuff made my eyeballs roll to the back of my head.",2,0

"This, basically, was a good book as it took place at the turn of the twentieth century.  Times were very different from today and some of the vocabulary used in this book was a little difficult to follow.  This told the tragedies that Mary Howard faced and hoe she overcame them.  The story was a bit dry at times but it was a book that was hard to put down, also.",4,1

"I had high hopes from the blurb - a unique and intriguing premise - and the story started out great. Unfortunately, the initial drama was over much too soon, and suddenly we're thrown forward eight years and the characters have changed completely.If I'm reading a ""reformed rake"" story, I want to SEE ""Lord Wicked"" change over time and EARN his redemption. Telling the reader ""it's eight years later and he's really really sorry"" just doesn't cut it. We miss out completely on the restless, conflicted wickedness and get him tirelessly patient, self-sacrificial and boring.Likewise, I would have been much more likely to have compassion and respect for the heroine if I could have SEEN the consequences of the initial drama. Instead, we leave Jillian as a 17-year-old caught up in the aftermath of a scandalous duel and never really understand what turned her into a rude, self-centered bitch. She refuses to acknowledge her own behavior in the fiasco and blames everyone else around her.I know the author was trying for an ""independent and feisty"" heroine, but Jillian veered off that narrow path straight into ""obnoxious and unlikeable.""A reformed rake needs someone worth reforming for, and Jillian - at least in the first part of the book - definitely isn't it. And Lord Wicked was already reformed by the time he got to her, so what's the point?",1,0
I do love a book that is short and spicy. This one was both. I felt for the heroine at first but did feel the book (I know its short) moved incredibly quick from virgin to sex pot in no time flat. Look forward to reading this author again and seeing more about the world she has created.,3,1
4*Over all I enjoyed this anthology. Another good book by Jess MichaelsSin's Wager 3.25*I enjoyed this erotic short story. Hawk and Bianca have loved each other for years but neither of them knew how the other felt. Bianca was married to Hawk 's best friend who's been dead for a couple of years. Now Bianca needs Hawks help and they strike a wager of a month worth of sin.The Sweetest Sin 4*This was a good erotic short story about a love that lasted through the heart ache of lies. Juliana lies to Landon to save her sister from her fathers gambling debts. Five years later Juliana goes to Landon to help her find her sister after her father has sold her to payoff a debt. I liked this story a lot it had a great story line.Sin's Mistress 3.75*This was a good erotic short story of a man bent on revenge and a woman he's going to use to mete out that revenge and ruin her in the process. Sin and Evelyn had great chemistry and some very hot sex.,4,1

"This book was good. It has a good set up of charaters(with some background, leads to a good plot and ends well.You meet Blue and Derek. Derek is a Dominant who is looking for a willing Submissive, who will endulge in his fantasies. Blue, who is out of a home, meets Derek. They both find each other attractive. Derek meets Blue for the first time, at Blue's place of employment. Derek is out seeking revenge. He was drugged and taken advantage of by a predator. When he sees the same man drugging and taking Blue away, he sweeps in and saves him.Derek, initially, plans on just helping Blue recover from the after affects of the drug and setting his free. But, Blue remembers who he is when he wakes up, despite being blindfolded and restrained. Blue, who is looking for a place to stay, decides Derek's place is good place to stay. Derek seemed kind hearted, with a dominant side that he kinda likes. Derek likes how Blue is willing to be submissive, but stills has a fiestiness to himself, that keeps him from being dull.As there relationship evolves, they continue to try to keep track of the predator. How far will each other Derek go to protect Blue? Will Derek and Blue finally be able to admit to there feelings for each other?So, I read reviews for book two.  It is about  Blue and Derek being involved in a Threesome.  I really dislike threesomes, when I have already grown to love a couple.  I have read reviews about it, but I still haven't brought myself to continue this series.  I want to continue this series;  I am afraid I will be soley disappointed by it.  In fact, I think if I had known that about book two beforehand, I might have skipped this series all together.",4,1

"I HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK.  I did anticipate it with excitement, though.  I read the first two in this series and thoroughly enjoyed them.  I really like sequels and the peeks into the lives of the former characters.  It makes the proceeding books seem like continued chapters of the first story.  The first book begged for sequels for each of the Grayhawk brothers and I was excited that Ms. Lee would write more about them.  I usually read the description of a book and then drop down to read the reviews.  I take them with a grain of salt, depending on the viewpoint of the writer, my interest in the description and my affection for the author.  Unfortunately, the reviews I read were very disappointing; so much so that I do not want to purchase this book.  There were a couple of suggestions for Ms. Lee, including making the next books more true to the characters and the theme of the previous books.  My suggestion -- which may seem a bit farfetched -- is for Ms. Lee to rewrite the third book.  The readers and lovers of the first two books, I am sure, would be forgiving if Ms. Lee were to rewrite the third book and keep Peyton true and believable.  I, for one, would be glad to purchase it and would heartfully await the stories of the other brothers with baited breath.  Ms. Lee, please consider it.  I would love to move forward in this series.

"I have enjoyed the entire Supernatural Bonds series so far and this is another great addition.I personally love it when the story's main character is a dragon, not only because I love dragons but because there are so few of these out there, in terms of the entire scope if paranormal writing.As per typical, we have an Alpha dragon seeking his mate.  I loved that this particular dragon was an oldie with specific ideas on how he was going to go about claiming his human mate, only to have it all go to pot once he found her.  Living through his frustration, all while seeing his extreme enjoyment, was quite amusing.In this book, I was a bit surprised that there wasn't a super baddie to be fought off, run from, protect against, as ie usually the way. After all, a good story has to have an antagonist/adversary right?  Without giving away key aspects of the story, I will simply say that in this story, the threat was not against his mate but rather someone she cared about.  Even with that, I have to say the threat was not much & I was left somewhat disappointed in how that part of the story was handled. To me that's part of the story I usually enjoy, so having it lacking left me feeling kind of uh.For the most part I consider this a good addition to the series.  It is certainly not my favorite of the series thus far, and was more sex and ""me dragon, you mine,"" than it was an actual completely written story, but it was enjoyable.Given that the books are all character continuation (the same characters connect throughout the series in one way or another), I would recommend starting at the first book in the series.  This certainly can be read as stand-alone, but I think the entire concept will be much more thoroughly enjoyed (some of the characters, their abilities, their mates familiar) if read in reading order.I have already started the next in the series, ""Conner's Wolf,"" and I am hopeful that Jory will get back on track with a great villain, good plot and engaging story as she has thus far with the Supernatural Bonds Series.  Enjoy! :)",4,1

"Orphaned at a young age and losing her grandmother at age seventeen, Nissa learned to be indepenedent and street-smart. She also knows what she wants, and what she wants is to be a part of the vampire sex club, Midnight Playground, to be the recipient of the Seeking Kiss (where vampires would take blood) and, if she were lucky, the Turning Kiss (to become a vampire, one of them). She was given the chance when a friend sponsored her entry. Almost immediately, two gorgeous vampires, Hex and his master Aleron, sought her out. Soon she finds herself falling for one of them.From the first page, I was captivated. Eden Bradley's prose and descriptions of the vampires and the club were rich in detail, making me feel I was really there. Also, there is something compelling and attractive about a woman who knows what she wants and who does all things possible to get it, even to the point of risking all.I don't think though that Nissa's fascination with vampires was ever explained. Why this obsession to enter the vampire sex club? Maybe as a place to belong, since she'd been virtually alone from a young age? However, the question didn't really bother me as I read along, ready to be swept into the fantasy, until this bit of conversation came along:She realized she was naked. And that Hex was lying beside her. When she turned her head his dark gaze was on her face.""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you."" He reached out, drew one finger along her jaw. ""But I can't stop looking at you. You've been so beautiful these past hours as you slept.""She didn't know what to say in response.Er, was she not beautiful when she was awake? However, we were told that she is, as both Hex and Aleron couldn't stop telling her how beautiful she was.Anyway...I like the twist in this story though. The sex scenes are hot and scorching, but I wish we could see more romance between the characters to justify the great and powerful love they felt.Reviewed by Silverfor The Romance Reviews",3,1

"As the other reviewers have described the book accurately, I will just give opinion. I made the mistake of reading SBFD first, not realizing it was a series, so Jon and Cole, very small parts in this book, already had my loyalty. I also liked Matt and Jared from Promises. I found Zach to be nice, but kind of an airhead. Angelo - ugh. No way. As one of the prev reviewers mentioned every relationship is different, but I had no respect for Zach for putting up w/ Angelo and saw nothing appealing or redeeming in Angelo's character to make it worthwhile. Additionally, I actually saw why Jon left Zach originally. Sweet but kind of goofy. The writing is good. I just need characters I can identify with or at least appreciate in some way.",2,0

This story is very short and not that good. It's kind of strange to see the two mothers from one of Shakespeare's classics turned into secret lovers.

"Ellen - You're now 2 for 2 on 2 Star reviews. Girlfriend, you need to double check your editor's work and keep an eye out on your reviews. I would think the error described below would be an(avoidable)embarrassment to an author.A previous reviewer, Catherine Winterfox (Portland, OR USA), sums up perfectly the 'Ooops!' moment near the end of the story...""Drew, our heroine, is heading out to the car after the hero's mother's wedding. She has to get her purse for her tampons, because her period has arrived ""with a vengeance"". Okay, fine, is the author going to use this? Maybe. Drew is kidnapped, stripped, and tied to a bed. When the hero finds her, he's afraid something horrible (well, more horrible) has happened, because she's bleeding. But no, he's referring to her arms, which are bleeding because she freed herself from the ropes binding her. Okay, not using the bleeding thing. Then, that night, they make mad, passionate love. This is a very straight couple--he'd never even had a girl on top, she couldn't identify a vibrator. They are not going to be doing anything with her bleeding. Also, she uses tampons, so there's a logistical problem. At this point, I paged back a bit just to make sure more time hadn't passed and I skimmed it. Nope, same night.It's a case of something very minor--the author using a tampon excuse to get the heroine alone to be kidnapped--turning into a major case of oops. An editor should have spotted it. I sure wish I hadn't.""And I totally agree...the mistake took away from the story. I hope someone contacts you about this and the mistake/error is correctable.",2,0
"This book single handedly brought the human race below that of monkey's.David is absolutely gross, and the fact that he had no remorse during the entire course of his developing affair made him into the lowest form of sub-human scum.His wife loves him, so much so that she want's him morning, noon and night. But is that enough to keep this guy happy? No. All it took was an easy POA to make this man completely forget about his love for his wife. If he ever loved her at all.This book grossed me out.",1,0

"I thought  'Simple Need' was an okay hot short story. I felt the Product description did a better job explaining the main H character then the book did. Basically Vinter approaches Elise, who was drowning her sorrows after a bad break up at the bar, and she agrees to go home with him. The product  description hyped up Vinter for me, but after reading the book I was kinda disappointed that I really didn't get more depth to his character. They spend the night and day fooling around and having sex which parts were hot to read some parts not so much. That's pretty much the story. I was expecting to be something more. So I was disappointed and am not planning on reading more of the other Inked books because I don't like paying for okay stories.",3,1
"****SPOILERS*******HIGH LEVEL: Vampire tale in the classic horror vein (pun intended). Atmosphere is ethereal and desperate.DO NOT read this if you are looking for a happy ending or a lusty romance. Think more Frankenstein than Sookie Stackhouse. DO NOT allow the plot description into letting you think this is another vampire love story or a Urban Fantasy take off of Pretty in Pink.CHARACTERS: Author uses a strange plot device in naming his main character ""Two."" I can only imagine that this was done deliberately to dehumanize her. It is jarring, to say the least, and serves to distance you from her throughout the book. I found myself constantly having to remember that ""Two"" was a person not a numerical reference. She comes across as two-dimensional, despite her trials. However, this was most likely the intention as it adds to the coldness of the story. The supporting characters are far more engaging, though the evil ""father"" is a true monster and serves only as a vehicle for evil. The best character is the tragic hero, Theroen, but be willing to have your heart torn out when you lose him.PLOT: Basic desperate struggle for love and acceptance- there is serious drug use, battered & abused women, whores, monsters, and other forms of desolation, loss and violence. This story is a tragedy and not one that shows any real hope. An attempt is made at the very end to indicate that Two will survive, but as your heart has been crushed, stomped on and scattered all over the ground by that point, it is too little, too late. There is a climactic point in the story that feels like the end, but then it continues and feels like a different book. I had a hard time reading past this point.BOTTOM LINE: This is NOTHING like your typical Dark Urban Fantasy and far more of a Horror. The images and events are brutal in their treatment of sex, women and life in general. I really, really didn't like it and would like to erase it from my mind, but this is only because it isn't the type of thing I'm into. If you are a fan of Horror and have no need of happily-ever-after, then you might like this.I have no recommendations that suit this book as it isn't my genre.",1,0
"What a lovely look at the journey some might take to love.  This is a wonderful treatment of &#34;gay for you&#34;.  Cooper Davis has done a wonderful job of character development, realistic emotions and engrossing dialogue.  It is nice to see the author take the time to have the readers understand how someone &#34;straight&#34; can fall so hard for someone of the same sex.  especially they consider a best friend.  While the story is told from Hunter's POV, you get to know Maxwell as well.  Hunter's journey to Max is very well done.  Highly recommended.",4,1
"unbelievable, but better than the start.  Not feeling the lead characters at all and will probably not read any additions.",3,1
"I enjoyed Astra Synchronicity, BUT...  The reason for the low rating I have given the book is primarily due to the fact Synchronicity is but the first installment in a larger story and does not stand on its own well.  More than that, the second book, Astra The Reckoning is an unbridled piece of garbage.  The main characters all start acting in ways contrary to their character and in doing so become loathsome.  I don't know about you, but I can't keep reading when the protagonists start acting in ways that show they are really just poor excuses for human beings.  If you invest your time in this series you will be disappointed.  Given my extreme disappointment with book 2, some of the failings in book 1 that I put up with now stick in my craw.  Namely, you can also look forward to such amateur hour goodies like the overuse and continued misuse of the word facade, and a protagonist with telekinetic powers who is too stupid to realize that he can win any fight by simply lifting his opponent off the ground and holding him there (or an author to stupid to think of that and at least address it).",1,0
The story definitely had intrigue and suspense.  I enjoyed it and would be interested in seeing the story developed into a full-length book.,4,1
"I try to finish every book I read in this genre, to give it a chance. It was hard to do with this one for several reasons. First, the premise wasn't very plausible to me. I try to overlook that, because as an erotic author myself, I know how difficult it is to get characters into a situation that requires lots of hot sex. So I would have been ok with that.However, the mechanical errors made it almost unreadable. It's been a few weeks since I read it, but I remember being very annoyed that the words ""so"" and ""such"" modified all sorts of concepts, without any ""that"" to follow up. It was very distracting, so much so that (see how you use that phrasing?) I began counting the instances.I hate to harshly criticize another indie author. I know how difficult it is to break into self-publishing on a shoestring, and I know the perils of editing your own stuff instead of hiring it done to save money when you haven't made any yet. I would suggest, however, that this author spring for it.",2,0

"I enjoyed this book. I can't say that about all books I read. Yes, it was a little juvenile, but it is a book about kids. I do wish that there had been a bit more detailed scenarios involving what was actually in the fog, or maybe some action sequences involving whatever inhabits the fog. All in all, it was definitely a good buy, I read the whole thing, and would recommend this to PA fans, and teens.",3,1
"Please don't let the reviewers who enjoy picking apart books sway you.  Often times what one person hates another loves.  Quite possibly you'll find you like this book.I didn't read the description of the book, nor the reviews before downloading it.  Sometimes I like going into a story blind because life is like that.  You never know where the road will lead.For my part, I only found a few things that threw me for loop.  The first one was when Alex, who'd been raised by her father her whole life, discovers her dad is a werewolf.  This is after we discover she believed there was no such thing as paranormal beings in the world.  One would think Alex would have struggled a tad more with the shocking news that werewolf's were real and guess what honey.  You're a half-breed.  Isn't that great?I would have gasped, stuttered and probably fainted, but within seconds of discovering this fact, Alex more or less shrugs her shoulders and goes on as though her belief hadn't just taken a turn into the bizarre.The second thing I struggled with was the fact that since Alex was `in heat'--as she was now maturing as a female werewolf--every time she looked at Joshua Striker, the hero, moisture was pooling you know where.  They had to watch out for werewolf's finding them because they, the mutts, could `smell her'.  I have to be honest and say, as often as Alex was having moisture pooling, I'd of smelt her too and I'm not a werewolf.  At least, I don't think I am.)Now that the negative is out of the way, and that's only my opinion, once I got past the above I found this book to be an enjoyable read.  It is an action packed adventure that had me turning the pages as quickly as I could.  N. J. Walters doesn't waste time going on and on with four or more pages of description.  The story moves along quickly.The bottom line, in my opinion:  If you like werewolf romance, don't mind some erotica and want a quick read, this book is for you.  The things I didn't like about the book aren't going to stop me from reading more from N. J. Walters, and will definitely be reading the second story in the series, ""Isaiah's Haven""!",4,1
"This was a guilty pleasure kind of book. The 'vengeance' aspect seems highly implausible and quaintly old-fashioned. The heroine is so principled it hurts, and the hero (who frankly must be a bit dumb if his vengeance idea is any indicator) suitably rich and handsome. But overall, it is harmless fun HEA.",3,1
"Ok so........Preston has one of the coldest attitudes towards his wife Delight and for the life of me, I cannot fathom how she deserves such harsh treatment from him after all he is the one that stepped outside of their marriage not her (although she definitely played a large role in his need to seek comfort outside his marriage). I do believe Mr. Williams accurately displays how current society has no staying power in relationships. Instead of working through things, it's easier to toss it to the side and start anew with another. Which is exactly what Preston is doing and his conscience is working overtime trying to save him. He fails to acknowledge how his actions or lack thereof are affecting his current and unborn children. And to think, he is working his way through the ministry......oh no that is one church I would not be attending. This book much like the first, had poor editing and grammatical errors. Mr. Williams has a good story line, but needs more attention to detail and some fine tuning.",2,0

"This free short story just didn't do it for me. I found it rather awkward actually and it shows that guys think more with their lower head than the one on top of their shoulders. It was written well enough, but I think the author could have done a little bit more with it. If there was a second book, I would understand. But there isn't, so I just don't know what to think.Ryan, a single man, divorced twice, is lacking some love in his life. That is until he finds a note on his car, receives a Facebook message and a creepy phone call from some random girl named `M.' They end up having phone sex. I can't imagine what kind of guy would do that with someone he doesn't even know. Then he decides to meet up with her and have sex in a pitch black room. I shook my head when the guy showed up to the sleazy motel. I thought this was going to be a good erotica gone bad. Sort of like a praying mantis taking off her mates head while they have sex. But that didn't happen. I think the book would have been better if that happened - just saying.This story is basically phone sex, then crappy real sex. Would I recommend you ask? No. That's all.",2,0
"For a first novel, I found this a pretty good read. There are 3 story lines that are well done and come together at the end. There is also a traitor in the midst of things, which keeps the suspense up.I really only found a few minor typos, so I did not find any of these distracting.Now, the women DO get pretty badly abused, except for one feisty gal. But, if you ever watch what happens in some of the lawless countries in Africa, or from some of the abuses women take in some Arab countries, it was totally believable.I did find the language a bit more 'formal' than I was used to, but I attributed that to this being by an author from the South. (We aren't nearly so polite here in the NorthEast!). It reminded me a bit of the style of the old western novels.I enjoyed reading the book, and found it more realistic than most of the self-published novels I've found so far.",4,1
"Three novels, only one of which involves Pirates or Buccaneers.  Occurs on Venus - no space travel, done by mental telepathy.  This is such a clone of the ERB style that it is unsurprising that he was allegedly outraged by it as a hijacking of the John Carter of Mars books.  That said it is so very like him that one wonders if he didn't write it under a pseudonym so that he could complain about it publicly and get free publicity for the stories.  Strong heroes, beautiful heroines adventure, danger, frustrated love that succeeds in the end - does this sound familiar.  Better than many of ERB's stories but not as good as his best.  Good period reading appropriately priced for Kindle.",4,1

"I felt like I had to trudge my way through the first few pages, this being before I knew it actually had (two) chapters. And within the first chapter, I literally had to force myself to read it, I fought the temptation to start skimming through it. But I could not offer quality review if I did, so grudgingly, I found chapter two.How the writer managed to cram three, maybe four erotic scenes into the first chapter, is beyond me. The first one was like, &#34;They could have done better&#34;, The second was a bit like the first, and the third was like a combo of the first two. Nothing new stirring the pot for these guys, they are just going through the motions after 500 years.I would imagine these guys just got tired of trying new things, and are just sticking to a routine.The story kicks into gear in the second chapter, finally.If I had known this, I would have skipped directly to chapter two. But even then, it still would have been a waste of time, because the story, at this point began to feel rushed, and there was little information given. So figuring out what was going on was completely lost. And then the next thing you know, it's over. So much for a story.I can't say this was the worst NN I have read.... Wait a minute. Let me re-phrase that.... This is not one of the worst, but it definitely is not one of their best. But I guess there is a reason they are offering certain books for free. And it's clearly not to get you into their collection, in hopes that you'll want to buy. NN's are a hit and miss, so I would not be likely to pay for any of them.",2,0

I first discovered HKW books last year and I admit I didn't expect much for a buck.. but I was floored!  I love this book!  Dark brooding male and beautiful damsel sure predictable but bring in faeries and demons and you have a great story!

2.5 out of 5 stars. My favorite character was Eric ... he sounded like a great guy. The plot was good but didn't end up the way I wanted it to which is the reason for the low rating.

"Ava Sweet has had a crush on her best friend's brother since high school.  After overhearing him discussing her in less than flattering terms she vows to prove to him that she's perfectly capable of being womanly - and not just `Dr. Doolittle' in baggy, ugly clothes.Luke McGiffin isn't oblivious to Ava's charms despite his attempts at denying them to his friend Pete.  The last thing he expected was for her to overhear their discussion or for Ava to lay a lip lock on Pete and demand a date that Friday night.Ava's always been shy and worn clothes that downplay her form, but Luke's oblivious attitude calls for a serious makeover and her friend Jen is more than happy to help.  Ava hopes the date will serve a dual purpose - bring her friend and Pete together and finally entice Luke to make a move on her.  The evening before her date with Pete, Ava receives a phone call from Luke that has her questioning if her plan is already working.Despite Luke's vow to do physical harm to Pete if he so much as touches her Ava and Pete continue with their plans for the evening but is Ava truly prepared for the reaction she'll receive once she's all dolled up and incites his jealousy.  Luke's a man with a strong sexual appetite and he's done his best for years to keep his desire for Ava at bay.  Is she prepared to handle his unleashed passionate nature?FORBIDDEN FRUIT is a simply delightful read that will have readers smiling their way through the antics of all the characters.  I couldn't help but laugh at Ava's reaction to Luke's thoughtless comments and how she goes about getting his attention.  I loved the realistic feel to this story and the friendship that's so apparent between Luke, Ava, Pete and Jen.  Anne Rainey charms her way into readers' hearts with flawed characters and situations that excite as much as they delight.  As if that's not enough for you to thoroughly enjoy this story, the red-hot smoldering tension and Luke's alpha personality will give you plenty of reasons to salivate.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",5,1
"This was a light and easy read, a little amateurish, but I quite enjoyed it, especially the second half of the story.Jim Richard had just turned 60. He didn't much like it, especially as he was now living back at his parent's house, in his old bedroom, after his divorce. But he was able to help his Mum with his Dad, who was very ill, when it was necessary. He spent most of his time on his computer, and when he received an email from an old flame, whom he hadn't seen in 40 years, who said her life was in mortal danger, he immediately tried to contact her.But he was too late, and along with Buck, his best (and only) friend, they decided to investigate, and find the killer. The police weren't too impressed with Jim, in fact he was a suspect for a time, but when they discovered a killer was stalking, sending warning emails, then killing Jim's old female classmates, they worked together, finding the remaining women, and putting them under police protection.The killer was too clever though, as those protected still died, so Jim and Buck upped the ante, putting their own lives in danger. Would they be able to stop the killer before all of the women had been killed? Would Jim and Buck suffer the same fate?",3,1

What a difference life was when this book was written.  The author gives such great details of the events then,4,1
I liked this authors style.  Book was well plotted and moved at a good pace.  Given the main character of the book is older this book will probably resonate best with those of us considered seniors.Good read.,4,1

The character though were very very well written and your really get to know both main characters and read what their feeling.  The thing that killed it for me again was the pace of the book, really slow.

"The story is strong, moving and beautifully written.  It's an improbable (to start) love story between bounty hunter Jace Rankin and ranch owner Kyla Springer Bailey.  Kyla has lost posession of her ranch, and her innocence, to her step brother Tom Hardesty. He has a thing for brutal rape as is demonstrated more than once in the book. He is a member of the corrupt Vigilance Union.Kyla travels to find help disguised as Kyle, a snot nosed teenage boy with less than no manners. The constant changes from Kyla to Kyle are well written and realistic, as is her use of the Kyle persona whenever she feels threatened.The love scenes are touchingly real.  The adventure and danger are thrilling.My problem was that I bought the book on Kindle.  It was soooo badly transcribed to kindle format that it was hard to follow.  At one point Jace was kissing Kyle instead of Kyla!  Give me a break!  Buy the book.  Don't buy it on Kindle until they fix the mess the publisher made of it.",3,1
"Okay. The author gets one star for the time it took to write this book. I googled the Scottish vampire myth and yeah, it's a real myth, and it's portrayed fairly accurately and might make an okay monster movie, but I expected more archeology and less cryptozoology. The author spends way too much time developing the various vampire types and the characters fade away into the bloodbath of the (often rididulous) action. I can suspend disbelief as well as most readers who like authors like James Rollins but this was just silly. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot, and dozing off occasionally. But to be fair, I read the whole book. It was tough going. I'm not sure it was even worth the price (.99). Give it a pass.",1,0

"If you're unfamiliar with Mary Hughes' Biting Love series...well...rectify that as soon as possible, but don't start here. The series starts withBite My Fire: A Biting Love storyand continues with the stronger second installment,Biting Nixie: A Biting Love Novel, and they're fun, relatively light, but definitely sexy/steamy/erotic vamp romance novels that blend humor and danger together quite nicely. The Bite of Silence is third in the series, but a short story instead of a full length novel like it's predecessors. Hughes has managed to condense the best parts of her books and deliver a powerful, funny, sexual, and surprisingly complete tale in a much smaller package. I believe, however, that this story would definitely feel lacking to anyone unfamiliar with the series, so start from the beginning.In The Bite of Silence, Nixie's best friend Twyla, Admin. Assistant for the mayor of Meier's Corners, is off to the Big Apple for a little New Year's Eve partying. When she boards the plane, however, she finds the object of her most delicious fantasies seated in first class. Niko is tall, dark, and destructively gorgeous...and Twyla's also pretty sure he's a vampire...but he's stubbornly refused to give her the time of day since he moved to town, so a two hour flight with the vamp is JUST what the vacation gods ordered. But Niko's not as unaffected by the delectable and funny Twyla as she thought...and her ""vacation"" surely isn't going to go as smooth as she'd hoped when she realizes that someone's trying to turn all the vampires in NYC into slavering, bloodthirsty beasts as the ball drops on the New Year and Twyla and Niko are the only two who can stop a madman from destroying them all.Points to Hughes for delivering a very well-rounded story in such a short format. There's even a bit more character development than I'd anticipated - and something that's so often lacking in stories of this length. Admittedly, I've read the first two books, so I'm already familiar with Hughes' world and vampire mythos, and I DON'T think that the book would read nearly as well for someone who isn't, so I rate it four stars for lacking any real world building at all. Other than that - very well told.",4,1

"Jake McBride is a self-made millionaire and womanizer extraordinaire. Emily Taylor is his efficient, smart, mousy, oh-so-uptight personal assistant.They have the perfect working relationship. Jake depends on Emily for everything, and Emily pretends to respect him. But then the unthinkable happens. Emily decides to branch out into the world of dating (as only the efficient, practical, and pragmatic would ever dream of doing) and somehow, Jake notices Emily is actually a woman. Not only does he notice, but it appears that every guy around has taken notice as well and Jake decides that he has to save Emily from herself and all the horny men of New York, who are all too willing to take advantage of his naive assistant.When Ms Marton gets it right, there is no Harlequin author better. How she is able to make these two characters (with their personalities) believable and engaging is beyond me. That she also manages to make them relatable and likable is a feat worthy of praise. I loved Jake, I loved Emily, and I loved all their little quirks and idiosyncrasies.I loved even more that I was able to laugh, get turned on, and get choked up all in 184 pages. By the last page I couldn't help but hold a hand to my chest and go 'Awww'. It's everything these short, quick reads are supposed to be. Thoroughly entertaining.",5,1
"I was disappointed with this story. In and of itself, it was ok if all you want to read about is one weekend of sex between 2 and 3 people. but the story part was lacking. Just as things get to a point where the story could be further developed, it ends. The whole thing could have been longer and more fleshed out. It took me maybe 45 minutes to read this book. For the price, it wasn't worth it.Wade is just kinda thrown in so that there is a 3rd person for the Menage part, and it's hardly believable. He's in love with another woman but it's ok to have sex with someone you don't know?",2,0
This is a very good story line...I'm not into women with women but not a lot of that in this book...I was into the story over all. I am going to read the next book....Very good auther lot of details to help along the way. Keep up the good work...linda b from florida,4,1
"The story line was a little slow at first, but soon picked up.  I wanted the love connection to start earlier than it did but in the end, it came out the way it should have.  Very entertaining and light-hearted. Would be good for anyone who longs for love in their life.",4,1
"M/M/F (2 bisexual males/1 straight female) usually doesn't work well for me for a multitude of reasons, and the love scenes usually make me roll my eyes. They tend to be purple and overdone. Not so in this book! The sex in this book curled my toes. I had to actually catch my breath after the first scene between Cassie and Kyle. Whew. And the heat never lets up! Every encounter in this book is a scorcher.The menage situation in this book is surprisingly believable. Cassie's attraction to both of her best friends and her heartbreak at discovering them together is sweet and realistic. Her reasons for leaving town make perfect sense. Even Kyle and Alan's reason for looking to each other for affection works pretty well. The story isn't perfect, but I found it much more believable than most M/M/F I've encountered.This book was on track to be an A+ read--and then the author pulled out the oldest menage clich&eacute; in the book. No spoilers here, but it's one of those ""love it or hate it"" issues and I'm in the latter camp.If I were to ever read this again, I'd stop after the last big love scene and skip the ending. All in all, a B- read. -9/22/08",4,1
I absolutely love this item.  I use my Kindle constantly throughout the day and even the night.  It is so helpful to be able to plan ahead and make sure my Kindle is ready when I am.

"I think the title says it all.  If the author could not think of a better title then why would I believe he could think of a good story.  It is hard to tell you how bad this story is without revealing much of the story.  So I will tell you that even though the story was not well written or thought out, at least I finished the book.",2,0
"I did not like the book, mainly because I hated the heroin. She is the quintessential bimbo. For example, driving to pick her boyfriend Zayne, whose life is in dire danger from a tornado, she still has time to remark : *Her boots looked much better against monster truck floorboards than against her sedan's plush, lamb's wool mat. Maybe she should sell the Mercedes*(location 3614-20).Not only is she so superficial she defines the word, she is also very ungrateful. All her life, she has been clothed (munificently), fed, cared for and educated by her parents. When she decides to move out, at 35 years-old !!!, they even buy and furnish an apartment for her. She should be thankful but instead, whines that they did not love her and cared for her as they should have (apparently, they were cold and otherwise occupied).The rest of the plot is unimaginative and could not rescue the story from the fallings of its main character.",1,0

Work, and words making a relationship what it should be.A++ for this novella, it did not leave you wondering at the conclusion.",5,1

I thought I was missing something by not reading this, but I hadn't missed anything.  It is well written, but not necessary if you are following the Black Dagger Brotherhood series.",3,1
This book was great!!  It was not filled with bad language or lots of details about the color of curtains or what flowers were in the room. There was a story to be told and Mr. Graham told it very well. I loved how he wove the scripture into the story as I believe every bad person has had some exposure to the word and God but has been hurt and rejected and is taking it out on the world. You are showing everyone that a good book can be entertaining without bad language or a lot of blood and guts. We get the idea they were stabbed and did not have to be subjected to how it was done.  Thank you again Mr. Graham and I look forward to many more books by you and maybe even some movies!!!,2,0
"This was surprisingly good. Although the plot was incredulous, the characters were more realistic than most; their dialogue was relatable  and the conversation was not pretentious. They communicated their feelings n I like that the h was outspoken. What I also liked was that the h's character was consistent; observations were made about her character by her father early in the story so it was easy to follow her behaviour or treatment towards the H. I loved this book.",5,1

"My Soul To Lose is a prequel novella to Rachel Vincent's popular series, Soul Screamers, which I have yet to read! While I think it probably isn't absolutely necessary to read this novella before the rest of the series, I found it to be a lovely introduction to the world and characters. It left me with a huge urge to read the first book which hopefully I'll get to do really soon! Sometimes novellas can be lacking in substance or feel like they were cut short but this one certainly wasn't.The story starts off with a bang. Kaylee Cavanaugh is trying to enjoy a day out with a friend but her 'panic attacks' are getting in the way of that. Kaylee's really having a tough time of it. She screams for no apparent reason and there's nothing she can do about it! Fearing she is mentally ill, she is admitted to a psychiatric unit and even had to be sedated for 15 hours. This story mostly takes place inside the unit. I've read a fair few books that feature psychiatric hospitals and I think of all of them, this one was the easiest to picture.Rachel Vincent's writing is just amazing! I could see everything clearly in my head and there was so much emotion throughout the story it was almost tangible. When Kaylee was having one of her attacks, it was described so well you could almost feel it yourself. You could sense her panic, fear and confusion. It really gets inside your head and makes you realize what Kaylee is going through. I just loved how real it all felt even if the circumstances and reasons behind it were a little surreal!This is definitely one to read in a single sitting. I was so captivated by the story, I couldn't tear my eyes away from Kindle. I loved the ideas, the mystery and the characters. Kaylee is a likable person and I'm looking forward to getting to know her better in the next book. If you want to test this series out, this novella is really a good way to do so! It will leave you hungry for more. I have a feeling I'm going to adore book one!",4,1
"My Thoughts - 5 out of 5 unicorns - I loved it!!!**Gifted to me by the author for an honest reviewOkay first things, this is a very adult erotic short story.  It is only about 25 pages, and it does have some very steamy sex scenes including some M/M/F.The cover is okay and shows the characters, but it doesn&#8217;t grab my attention.  You definitely don&#8217;t want to judge this book by its cover.Okay I loved this story, but if you aren&#8217;t into stories of threesomes or sex scenes then don&#8217;t read this story.  It is a quick read, but it totally had my attention.  You get glimpses into the lives of the 3 characters in this book and some background.  I&#8217;m not usually one for short stories, but Kallysten always does such a fantastic job of sucking me right into her stories.I totally recommend this book to paranormal romance lovers and to anyone who loves Kally&#8217;s work.  I can&#8217;t wait to read more of this series in the future.",5,1
"In &#34;Angel be good&#34; our heroine Daphne saves the life of a man she barely knows during Vietnam war and dies instead when it was not really her time; when she gets to heaven she requests to return to earth to be able to live her life.After some time the &#8220;Angelic council&#8221; agrees to send her back with the condition that she  grants them a favor. They need her to save the soul of the son of the very same man for who she lost her life. Turns out that the soul she has to save belongs to a really sexy - though cold hearted - 30 years old business man and that she only has one night to convince him that love and goodness exists. Lucky for her it is Christmas!The plot moves very fast as almost everything happens during one Christmas night but I enjoyed the way it is written. An important remark is that this is not the traditional clean Christmas tale; there are sex scenes though not too graphic.I truly enjoyed this book, it is sweet and even emotive and it talks about redemption and second chances. My only complaint would be that it ends quite abruptly on 76% of the kindle edition, but it does have an epilogue so at least we have the happy ever after.",4,1
"Every now and then I get the craving to read a hot M/M story. And this was just what I was looking for! I think I found another favorite author in Evangeline Anderson. The way she writes the chemistry between these two guys is amazing. The sexual tension in here is felt all the way through. To the point you feel like a voyeur in the room watching all of this go down.The &#34;Gay Chicken&#34; games Duke would come up with was hilarious!! I would laugh overtime they played because it was so obvious how they truly felt. But were afraid to admit to each other just yet.Especially Mav. And Duke had this whole persona going that was actually believable for a while there until midway through the books things begin becoming more apparent than ever.The sex scenes are so extremely hot. I'm a fan of dirty talk when it comes to Smut. And this includes a good deal of that throughout the book. I think the sexual tension & chemistry between these two is so hot that it feels like it literally jumps off the pages.I think this book is a fun, light, sexy ready if your looking for a hot M/M books with a HEA with light angst than search no further. I'd love if this was longer or to have it to maybe continue into a series. I'd be interesting in series where life continues to take Duke & Mav down in Florida. 5 FABULOUS FUN STARS!",5,1
"This is Twain's satire of contemporary religious mores. It was the last fiction he published in his lifetime, and like much of his later work, it's slightly cynical and very sarcastic, although more upbeat than, for example, _Letters from the Earth_ -- mankind comes across as looking fairly silly overall, but on the whole positive.Probably of most interest to Twain fans who want to read everything of his that they can, or to scholars writing on Twain's religious views, more than to casual Twain readers. It's mildly amusing throughout, but no more than that, and Twain certainly wrote many other works that were more entertaining and more insightful.It's a fairly short read, at 630 kindle ""locations"".",4,1
"I get that sometimes characters are antagonistic and irritating... but to have 3 out of the 4 main characters that way through most of the book was a bit much for me. They were well developed, deep and worked great in the story. The sex, as always, was hot. The ideas behind the story were good. I know there are more in this series and will read the others because I love Tymber's books and am hoping for some redemption in the next one.",3,1

"H. Beam Piper didn't invent the parallel universes concept, but he did more than almost anyone else to popularize it.Piper's Paratime is an infinite band of parallel Earths, each splitting off as the result of a decision somewhere in history. The resulting levels range from uninhabited Earths to Earths with high space-faring civilizations. And one of those Earths discovered how to travel between these worlds.Of course a paratime traveling civilization opens the possibility of all sorts of mischief and requires a police force. Since the Original Time Line has exhausted its resources, it needs paratime travel to obtain the resources it requires to continue to exist. It's the job of the Paratime Police to keep order among the paratimers and to keep the Paratime Secret at all costs.These stories are built around the career of Verkan Val, paratime policeman extraordinary, and his efforts to help his culture keep the Paratime Secret. It's not an easy job. In the course of these stories Val has to recover a Venusian Night Hound that has been let loose on our timeline (late-40's Pennsylvania to be exact), get his sometime-wife Dalla off a world where reincarnation is scientifically proven fact before she overturns the entire civilization, and battle a gang of trans time slavers whose roots reach into the very heart of the Original Time Line government itself.Most of these stories originally appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in the late 40s and 50s. Like most Astounding offerings, they're full of high action against well-thought-out backgrounds and spiced with interesting characters. It makes for a colorful offering.Although Piper had been writing science fiction for more than 15 years, he didn't attract real notice until his last Paratime story, Lord Kalvin of Otherwhen, and the unrelated Little Fuzzy. Unfortunately, depressed by financial troubles, he committed suicide just as his career was taking off. It's good to have this collection to help remember H. Beam Piper at his best.",5,1

"In an effort to save his brother from a gold diggerr and  himself, older brother Nikias Dranias goes to great lengths to keep the lovebirds apart.  Diona Brown goes to Greece to stop her younger sister, Daryle, from marrying a man she's only known a week-Nikais' s brother, Alexis. Mistakenly, and arrogantly, believing that there is only one Ms. Brown, Nikais spirits Diona away go his private island, cuts all phone service to his home, and threatens all islanders with unemployment if they assist her.  What follows is predictable, but we'll written and sweet.",3,1
"Celia Evans wants it all.  She wanted the great love, passion, and excitement.  She almost had it all in Parker West, but he was predictable, boring, and proposed to her in a most unromantic way.  Celia was not selfish, but she refused to settle for less than everything, so she turned down the unacceptable proposal.  When Parker showed up at her front door, tied her up, and carried her off to an unknown location, she was frightened, but yet excited by his spontaneity.Parker was risking everything on this last chance effort.  He had known the difficult Celia all his life, and being a kind gentleman had gotten him nowhere, so he hoped unleashing his darker dominant side might penetrate her steel defenses.  When they arrived at his cabin, she responded to this side of him better than he could have ever anticipated.  If he would have known this was all it took, he would have introduced this aspect of his sexuality years ago.  His next proposal, although done while both of them were naked and in bed, was readily accepted.When neighbor Rance Colter tried to stop the quickie wedding in town, Parker knew it was only a sign of things to come.  He knew that Rance had wanted to claim Celia for his own, but she had never wanted him in return.  Now that Celia was his, Parker set up extra protection at his ranch as well as Celia's.  He didn't put anything past Colter, and knew he would try something soon.  Her being married would not stop him.  That is one thing Parker had no doubt about.  When Celia was abducted from home, both families swore she would be returned unharmed whatever the cost.A traditional formula that works well with this story.  Parker and Celia are a very explosive pair.  They do nothing half way whether it is fighting or lovin!  The erotic scenes are combustible.",4,1

"When I first started reading CLASSMATE MURDERS, which was a free download, I was not at all sure I was going to stick with it, simply because the idea of an unemployed 60 year old living with his parents did not exactly resonate with me.I am so glad I kept reading, because soon enough the character of Jim Richards became very appealing to me, and I could not put the book down.  Although it has a great plot and plenty of murder, it is deftly written with a light touch, with just the right blend of humor and mystery.  The characters are clearly defined and before you know it, you are along for the ride.What started as a freebie has become an obsession for me, as I have just started on book #9 of the Jim Richards series. I not only highly recommend this first book, CLASSMATE MURDERS, which started it all, but I strongly suggest reading the books in order.  While the books can stand on their own, the charm and appeal of the books (for me, at least) lie in the characters, who feel like friends with whom you don't want to lose touch.  I love a good mystery, which this book has in spades, with just the right dose of humor, fun and friendship thrown in for good measure.  I am relieved to see there are a number of Jim Richards books in the series, because I am certainly not ready to say goodbye to this crew.",5,1
"This is the prequel novel to the `Soul Screamers' series.16-year-old Kaylee suffers from what she calls `panic attacks', but these are not what everyone else would call panic attacks. Instead, these happen every time she comes around someone who is about to die. First her throat closes up, then she feels pressure in her chest, and if she doesn't get away then, a painful scream rips out of her throat, and she can do nothing to stop it.Whilst shopping for her prom it happens twice. The first time she manages to get away in time, the second time she's not so lucky, and the scream rips out of her.Now Kaylee's being held in a mental health facility, and they won't let her leave.Is she schizophrenic though? Is she suffering from delusions and hallucinations? Or is something otherworldly going on?I've had this book sat on my shelf for ages, and I finally decided to make time to read it. Yay!I have to say that I loved Kaylee! I loved how she so adamantly claimed she wasn't crazy, and even did the rational thing and took the drugs, even though she knew she didn't need them. I also loved how funny she was - telling someone that she was in the institution because she didn't speak, and telling one of the therapists that she was only there because the doors were locked! Loved that one! I really felt for her though. It would kill me to be locked up in an institution somewhere and have people telling me that I was crazy because of circumstances out of my control. How awful to also suddenly start screaming and not be able to stop too! Really awful, and so embarrassing!I thought the storyline here was pretty unique. I've read books before where people know when people are going to die, but I've never come across something like this! I really liked this twist of Kaylee being forced to scream, and I'm really interested to find out what will happen to her in the rest of the series!Overall; an enjoyable and unique start to what promises to be an awesome series!7 out of 10.",4,1

I thought NoWry did a great job developing strong characters that make you root for their success or demise depending on which way your moral compass points.

So after a bit of research, I think this is the book I should be reading.***Yep, that felt like a beginning. Though there is a creature similar to a vampire and I am not sure if the main character is human. I am not used to reading books about other humanoid beings.

"I liked this book, but I didn't love it. There were some pacing issues for me. Also, I liked the characters, well I liked Lorenzo, and I am ambivalent about Sandalini.This book featured an SFPD detective, Gabriel Sandalini, and an FBI agent, Antonio Lorenzo who went deep undercover to bust a mexican drug cartel. From the beginning, Lorenzo & Sandlini were drawn to each other, but they were unaware that the other was one of the good guys.So they fought their attraction because 1) it was disturbing being attracted to such a bad character and 2) there would be no future as betrayal and arrests were inevitable.Unfortunately, one of them got their cover blown. Now they are in the fight of their lives. It's hard to even focus on love, when you have to watch your back against everyone.I never connected with Sandalini. He was a reckless smart mouth kid. He wasn't as tough as he thought he was. He was annoying. then I didn't understand how a hardened agent like Lorenzo could be so sensitive when he comes to Sandalini. I like them together but something was missing for me. I think it was the writing. It was too sterile for me. the only real show of emotion from Sandalini was a prelude to sex or during sex or post sex. Whereas Lorenzo wore his heart on his sleeve. I don't know how the heck Lorenzo made it as an FBI undercover agent. He is too nice. I would have liked him to be vocal with Gabriel. I will read book 2 to see they are progressing.",3,1
"Unable to believe the number of business trips his brother-in-law Keith O'Connell makes to Dundee, Idaho, Isaac Russell decides to serendipitously follow him.  Isaac is stunned to find that Keith has another wife with three young daughters besides his sibling Liz.Forced to make a decision, Keith chooses his Idaho family for the sake of his offspring.  When his despondent sister Liz decides to follow her ""husband"" to Idaho, Isaac does likewise to insure she does not break the law by doing something stupid or even try to do something stupider like getting her ""husband"" to come back to her.  Complicating matters at least in Isaac's mind is his attraction to Keith's schoolteacher first wife Reenie Holbrook, who uses her maiden name.Big girls do cry when they suffer broken hearts as both women do when the truth about Keith's bigamy surfaces.  However, Reenie recovers faster perhaps because she has the kids to take care of (no time for breakdowns) and the interest of Isaac to help her move on while Liz feels abandoned and betrayed first by her two-timing spouse and then her brother.  She and the kids provide the fresh extended look at the impact of bigamy.Harriet Klausner",4,1

"Ctales Publishing should hire me as an editor.  My qualifications?  Let's count them:1.  I understand the proper use of commas, colons, semi-colons and periods.2.  I understand that, when conversing with each other, people do not say ""I am"" or ""it is"".  They say ""I'm"" and ""it's"".  This is especially true in high stress situations.3.  When writing, I know to identify the subjects of a scene with a break in text or a completely new chapter.  The writer tended to shift to new scenes by starting new paragraphs with zero indications that the scene was shifting.4.  I can frigging spell!!!!  More specifically, while using any decent word processing software, I recognize the significance of the red, squiggly lines under words.5.  Notice, there are zero run-on sentences in my review.I truly enjoy post-apocalypse-world stories however, if this is what passes for acceptable writing, I weep for our literary future.As for the characters, Dora, Tim and Mary would not survive more than a week in my zombie bunker.  I'd shoot them in the knees, throw them outside and ring the dinner bell. All three would make acceptable zombie bait.  Please, don't think me cruel and heartless; I'd graciously end it before they turned.Paige could stay because she became an asset over time.Does anyone know what Mike's fate was?

At first I had a hard time with Hunter.  I have to say, I'm not usually one for stories where the ""Hero"" is more of a beast than man, but after reading this story, I realized that Hunter never knew true love, and was never really shown it. It was a little rough in the beginning, but I can't lie...the sex was HOT HOT HOT!! For something different, and if you can have an open mind, I think you would enjoy this story.",5,1
A short story. It was okay but I have to say that I felt that the lead female was annoying at times. She sat her butt at home doing nothing but harassing her husband who was working hard to maintain her lifestyle - a lifestyle that she claimed she didn't really want yet she indulged in it.  She needed some hobbies or she needed to use her college degree . As for her hiding her past from her husband of seven years a past that wasn't even all that scandalous was ridiculous to me. And she was too preoccupied with her husband pulling her hair . Dude was tired lol  She was very immature and insecure.,3,1
All of the books by Cliff Black have been great! I've read them and wish there were more! Good job. Write some more Soon!,4,1
This collection let me get started with the Westmoreland Series. When I was little I remember these books hanging around but my first Brenda Jackson book was the one with Taylor and Dominick; I enjoyed going a decade back in time to read about this family. I loved the first book in the series.The price is well worth it in my opinion,4,1
"If you have been cheated on, read this, you can turn your life around. Holiday of a lifetime becomes love of a lifetime.",4,1
"This book was a great, quick, sexy read. My issues with with the very thin plot. To me, it was like an underdeveloped version of ""Hot Head,"" taking place in college instead of a firehouse. It could have used another 50 or so pages of buildup and depth. I'd still read this again. What can I say, I'm a sucker for ""gay for you"" books with tall, hot guys!",3,1
"This wound up being a much quicker read then I anticipated. I thought it a novel, but it's more of a short story to intro her Soul Screamers series. I read it in one sitting and very much enjoyed the read. I was very sympathetic to the protagonist within the first few pages and couldn't tear myself away from the book as I wanted to know what happened next, and next, and next. Great hook for the series.",4,1
"""Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book, as part of a promotional tour, in return for an honest review.""Charlie lost everything when her fathers fortune went up in smoke. Hiding on a mining planet with her brother she's struggling to survive.

"At the time that I write this review, there are currently 14 other reviews all with 5 stars.  I am giving this 3 stars because I didn't find anything truly outstanding about this book.Most of the stort stories are in a first-person point-of-view, as told by Adam.  However, there are a few that are not and I found that confusing.  Also, there is one story (Michigan) in which the narrator refers to himself as Noah.  Who is Noah?  Later in another story, when Adam speaks of losing his grandmother, I can only assume that it was Adam at the hosptial/nursing home.  Why he said his name was Noah, I still do not know.The final issue I have with the book is that some of the sentences I had to read over and over again.  They were phrased so strangely that they barely made sense.  I could have though of many other ways to have written those sentences and I am by no means a writer.The collection of stories all and all were good, not great.  The bottomline is: I wasn't hooked and I did not feel the urge to read every chance I got, as I do with REALLY good books.",3,1
"Even at a $2.00 price point, the cost for this book is too high.  If a story has typos or lacks a complete plot line or demonstrates clearly sloppy fact checking (since when does the Navy have the rank of Major?), its not the end of the world, though slightly eye-roll worthy.  When all three collide - as they do in Reno's Chance - it makes it almost impossible to stomach, let alone finish the story.  Go buy a fancy Starbucks-esque drink with the money, you'll enjoy it more.",1,0
"This book was ok.  the story line could have been more developed, but I found the brothers charming.  The beginning pulled me in, but the story line got sketchy once the sex started. It lacked physical descriptions of the characters and during the parts where the characters were getting physical it got a little vague.  I think she has potential as an author though and for lighter reading I will try more of her books.",3,1
"First off I LOVE CRYSTAL JORDAN!- Great new series - Book 1 - This story is about Aubrey a coffee shop owner who is given a warning from a local homeless guy Jerrico to beware of fire. After his perdiction her business goes up in a fire. He then makes another prediction that she will meet her ""soulmate"". Aubrey not thinking of love after a bad divorce ignores his prediction again. But when police chief Price Delacroix comes to the shop to look at the fire damage she goes up in flames as well. This is a great angel on your shoulder love story with lots of hot scenes.",4,1
"Be aware that this a short story. As I did not read any of the other, apparently longer, books in the series, it was not very satisfying.Basically, Keely and Jack are getting married, and the bride really wants the reception to be over and the wedding night to start. She tries to seduce her husband all the way to the hotel where the two-weeks honeymoon is supposed to take place. He steadfasly resists her, for reasons that made no sense to me. Having your brand-new husband refuse your advances sounds less than romantic ! As a reader, you're also being teased all the way to the bedroom without the big finale.Dumb plot and shortness set aside, the story itself is well written and there are glimpses of humor and interesting characters. I would presume that if I had read any of the Rough Riders books, I would not have been so disappointed.",2,0
"The plot, or what I thought was a plot, was interesting, and it was a good price so I thought I would check this out while waiting for some new books to come out in other various series I am reading.  Anyway, this book is basically all sex, and sex, and more sex.  Not much of a story in between.  I like some erotic scenes, but I am saying this book was just ALL those kind of scenes.  It was just too much sex, and not enough story.  Not at all realistic as far as how things ended up either.  Skip this one!",2,0
"This book is good to read, easy to follow and it makes you think your're actually living with the Apache's.",4,1
"I read about 60% of the  book and couldn't take it anymore. I really liked the story line and the idea for this book, but the writing was so annoying; too much description and too contrived for me. The ""heroes"" were over the top in abilities and preparation and knowledge. This is one book that I am glad didn't cost more than $1.",2,0
"Not very romantic, and not very steamy, with the distracting element of one of the characters being psychic.  Very little actually happens.",2,0
no plot no character just a free excuse for a couple of badly written smut scenes. not worth the time to read it,1,0
"Story line wasn't bad but the writing was choppy, the f word seemed to be thrown in randomly for shock value. Personally I am not a fan of nasty language in books. This was more of a erotica story than a romance and was not really worth my time.",2,0
I enjoyed the book greatly.  There could have been better editing.  I really liked the plot.  There is really not much more I can say about this book,3,1
"Having been a devoted fan of Lovecraft all my life (he's my all-time favorite writer), I HAD to buy this book for the Kindle I just received today. It has almost all of his stories ... for only 1.99! That's less than 200 pennies! So far I only read From Beyond, one of my favorite stories of his. I found a few small typos, but that's okay. Editors are not perfect! Every book on the market has a least a couple of errors in them. I'm still giving this 5 stars. It's H.P. Lovecraft! HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended if you're an H.P. fan!",5,1
"I am really enjoying the story and the characters (am still reading), but there are quite a few very distracting errors.  In one scene, JD Ryan is suddenly ""Riley,"" and ""Turner"" randomly becomes ""Tanner"" at other points.  The book is not riddled with errors, but that's a pretty big one, something I expect to have been caught in editing with a book this pricey.  Once or twice I could overlook, but it would happen for whole scenes, and it really threw me out of the book.",3,1
It was a very good storyline and great book. Give it a go! You won't regret it at all! Fab,4,1
This was a free read by the author & Amazon. This was as good her other book (perfect proposal) but longer.,5,1
"Think i got this book for free, thank God because if i would have paid even $.99 i would have been mad! I agree with another reviewer that it seemed like several authors put this together, it was all over the place. One of the worst stories I've read in years. And did anyone else think that Paul was pissed with Dale was because he wanted Dale for himself? I was so sure that they were going to end up together or in a threesome with Janet. Either way this booked sucked.",1,0
I think I expected too much from this book so I was disappointed and had a hard time getting into the story.,3,1
"This story was good enough to make me consider giving the series a second chance. The book was still a fun clean light read. Events were more believable and it was refreshing to have Ron and Charlie work together on the case. I was even uncertain on who done it. Although the book can be read solo, this one would be better if you read a few of the others first.",4,1
"What is the book about?Two bulls is searching for John Piver, the man who raped his grand daughter, Feather. Once he finds John, he watches and studies him, making him edgy. Two bulls is overcome with guilt and shame as he attempts to kill John but finds himself unsuccessful.John's wife, Mary are in a loveless marriage, but she is still curious as to why her husband is in danger from an Indian who is attacking in a very personal way. Mary demands that Two Bulls explain the truth behind the attack, and when she finds out she finally gets the nerve to leave John.What did I think of the book?You will find sympathy in every character except John. Mary and Elizabeth are just innocents, forced to waste their life with a selfish and stubborn man like John. Two Bulls is just a man in search of finding revenge against all that have mistreated his people in any way.John is a character, that you will loathe and your rooting for all the people around him to escape his wrath.I enjoyed reading this book, it had a lot of depth to each of the characters head.",2,0
"I picked my copy up for free and I wouldn't have paid for it. It was very easy reading and something about it just seemed too simple. I've read a lot of other similar books that I enjoyed better. If it's still free, I'd say go for it though. It was easy to read, went by quickly and helped pass some time.",3,1
"What a bargain for all of Twain's (Clemens) works together, in Kindle form. I'll enjoy this for years, as I re-read my favorites frequently.",5,1
"I rated this a 5 * based on how interesting it is and how it kept my attention..Not going into details , I would just say its from another great author that I will continue to read..",5,1
"First off, I just read above where this story had been re-edited in 2011. If so, why was the revised edition not put on Amazon? This story was truly hard to get through, mainly because I had to keep going back and re-reading many, many sentences because they were huge run on sentences and did not make sense the first time I read them. Secondly, comma or no comma? They were everywhere, almost like the author threw darts at his manuscript and wherever the darts landed is where he put them.The concept of the story itself was interesting, sort of. I just don't know really what to do with this story. I love to re-read my zombie books, but this one you couldn't pay me to even glance at, mainly because it took so darn long to slog through it because of the wordiness and the errors. I gave it 3 stars because it was an original idea, and didn't want to be mean.",3,1

"First, Frank Tuttle is certifiable, but in a good way. I've found myself saying, ""This isn't my favorite genre"" a lot lately. I discovered Frank on the Kindle Discussion boards and his posts were so hilarious that I just had to try his books. If you haven't read his blog, be warned: Do not have a beverage near your computer when you read the entry about the lawnmower.That said, I read Dead Man's Rain first and had so many questions that I emailed Frank. What's a Jerk? Which war was this, where is this set, etc. Silly me, still forgetting that this is a fantasy. I missed out on a lot of the background by not reading The Mister Trophy first, so if you're reading this and haven't read any of the other Markhat series yet, definitely start with this one. He answered me right away. But you can save yourself the embarrassment of having to be told, in the nicest possible way, ""It's all a fantasy, I made it up"". I would have gotten that immediately if I had read the books in order.To paraphrase one of the best lines from the book, a troll should never smile at someone he likes. I almost dropped my Kindle.The Misters are trolls. These are not your cutesy little bridge trolls (or even the ones who hang out on discussion boards), that would be too easy. These are big, scary, long-fanged, gargly-voiced trolls with translation spells, definitely not adorable.Markhat is a 'finder', Tuttle-speak for Private Eye. He's also a smart aleck and as entertaining as protaganists get. The book is short, but that's okay, there are three more to read, soon to be four.The Markhat world also features vampires, aka the half-dead, ogres, Mamma Hog, a reader who mothers - and puts hexes on - the sometimes reckless Markhat.All of this sounded silly to me when I read the description, but Frank manages to take all this insanity and turn it into a wildly entertaining read.Start with this one and keep on going...they just keep getting better! The price is right and even if you've never liked fantasy novels before (I hadn't), you'll love these.",5,1
"it was a quick read and did not have enough depth. liked the idea of some f the punishments, but it was rushed. and some arts were confusing. I should retread a section of a story for one reason only, it was hot and had to read it again because... wow! um, read some lines again because it was kind of confusing. but like I said, liked the idea though. will read their work again, I liked their writing style, next time more to the story. that magic stuff was unneeded fluff or nt fluff enough.",2,0
"From reading the other reviews I was very interested in this book. Unfortunately I did not feel it lived up to the 4 and 5 ratings. While the story line was good it was predictable. Also I was not that impressed with the steamy scenes. From what I read I was expecting something along the lines of Jaid Black, Emma Holly, or Maya Banks. Instead it was much milder than expected for BDSM.",2,0

"I will not review the novel's main theme as this has been presented in the detailed product description. Coombe's Woods holds more than the darkness, and there is a reason why. Izzy's unique approach to getting rid of George, leaves a smile on your face. This novel is fun to read. There is action, danger, and, of course, romance. The romance with her neighbor gives this book a little spice. Get comfortable and read this! It is one of the better romantic suspense novels I have read lately, especially with the paranormal twist it has. Highly recommended!",4,1
"Christopher Pinckley has written a step by step guide to becoming who you want to be.  The first part of the book involves the steps required to learn or decide what or who you want to be.  This is not as easy as it seems.  So many of us get into the flow of our lives and never really stop to analyze what it is that we want.  This in depth look at what we want is very important if we are to manifest ourselves and become what we want.  The second step involves getting rid of the barriers that we all carry as baggage that prevent up from becoming what we dream of becoming and the last step involves getting to where we want to be.The author has been where most of us start.  He did not know who he was or who he wanted to become.  He had these ill defined goals and he had plenty of baggage preventing him from realizing even these ill defined goals.  Having been there, he can better guide us through these processes.The book is broken down into easy to read chapters and I was surprised at the practical exercises that he gives to make it easy to get from one step to another.  Without these concrete exercises this book might just be another ""go our and realize your dream"" books.  There is much more than that here.This book is a good read for people of all ages even if you think that you have found what you want and are already there.  Looking into our desires is a compelling and interesting exercise, no matter how old or successful we think that we are.",5,1
"Just for the pure enjoyment and entertainment factors, I loved SERIAL.  It is very graphic with violence, but I didn't think it was much worse than some of the thrillers that are out there today that I've read.  The two authors collaborating on this agreed that one mind was as sick as the other, and I'll agree, but I think the plot of two serial killers working alone and then what happens when the two of them meet up is very clever.  I read this very fast because I couldn't wait to see what happened.  This isn't SERIAL UNCUT, but a shorter version of it.  If these two writers intended to make me feel a little creepy, unnerved, like I had to keep reading, and totally entertained, then they accomplished their goal.  If you love thrillers and horror, something that gives you a very unsettled feeling, then this is for you. This is the first time I've seen the term ""recreational murder"" in any kind of mystery or suspense thriller.  I hope that's one term that doesn't become popular.There are three other excerpts from books included:  Desert Places by Blake Crouch, Shaken by J.A. Konrath, Draculas by J.A. Konrath, Jeff Strand and F. Paul Wilson.There is a list of each authors' works that are available for the Kindle at the end of the last excerpt. I didn't recognize the name of J.A. Kornrath, but he's the author of the Jack Daniels thriller series which includes Whiskey Sour and Bloody Mary.  I've read Whiskey Sour and enjoyed that one.  The authors are not unknown authors, and if you like things that go bump in the night or even in the daytime, then SERIAL is a good choice for a free download.",5,1
the beginning was interesting and then quickly became silly. everything is so rushed! within one month he says &#34;become a vampire and we will live forever together&#34;. worse yet is she says ok with no questions asked. the plotline was just strange and rushed. there was no real emotions in the characters and the sex scenes were just plain sad. the entire book was him apologizing and her saying everything will be ok. i wanted to like it but had to force myself to finish it (i skimmed the last chapters). the ending is just plain ridiculous!  what a waste of two hours......,2,0
"This was kind of a hit and miss book for me. There were parts that I really enjoyed, but other parts... not so much. The great part about this book is that it's sort of a story within a story. A book within a book. I loved that concept and I think it was executed quite well.As a fantasy novel there is the quest aspect of the story, and that takes us into a magical land with spirits, magicians, and an enemy of the queen who has his own minion army. One part of the book that is memorable, to me at least, was the Evil Army Recruitment Questionnaire. It just made me laugh (e.g. one of the questions was ""Do you like to play with fire?"" and the two options were ""Yes"" and ""Yes!"").Bethany, our main character, is quite young seeming and naive. She's hiding something that comes to light part way through the story and I just couldn't believe what I was reading. It actually really turned me off the book. I was enjoying the fantasy narrative, but then we found out about this secret she was hiding and it was absolutely insane. I can't be specific about it because it would be a major spoiler, but it just made me wonder where Bethany's brain was at, it was so ludicrous.Some scenes in 'Running From Secrets' seemed almost rushed through, while others were well paced and thought out. Therefore sometimes I was really into the book and wanted to see where the story was going, and other times I was a little bored. Overall I thought the book came to a pretty satisfying conclusion, and I think it's worth reading for the interesting story within a story and world creation.",3,1
Another great story from Ms. Kallysten.  I will admit that I wasn't as big of a fan of Lisa as I was of the of two. I normally like really strong confident women but she was just a little too sure of her self for me.  As usual the sex in this was extremely hot and very well written. She does really well with making you connect with her characters in such a short time. I look forward to more in this series.,4,1
"There is nothing original in this very short Regency M/M romance.The setting is the usual one, gay aristocrats having to cope with the homophobic, claustrophobic mores of a time and society when laws founded on religious beliefs used to fetter people's life.To this well trodden setting the author adds the usual topic of forced proximity as the two lovers are bound to remain in the same place for a given numer of days and have no way to avoid each other, again a very common choice in this kind of novels.There is one twist though: the two star-crossed lovers have not only already met (this would be common) but they have been lovers in their early youth, until they were separated when one of them, a second son and therefore kind of useless to his father, was sent to war to acquire a status for himself. Problem is that, after five years, he had to come back because (second twist) he has lost his left forearm. Haunted by honour, duty and guilt Ian (the come-back soldier) has to be seduced again because he seems to consider the previous affair with Nicky a juvenile mistake and the attraction he still feels for Nicky something to be repressed.I will not spoil the third twist (a bit contrived) that allows them their happily ever after.All in all the story was captivating. The two main characters are easy to love even if the soldier sounds more childish, at times, than guilt-ridden and the other lover seems a little too unsouciant.The story could surely have born more fleshing out: it takes place within a limited time scope (twelve days) but it needs not have taken twelve pages to be told. There are several moments that feel hurried and character building could have been better.More care should have also been given to the sex scenes: they are emotional because of the baggage the two carry with them but they are not very erotic.",3,1
How can you go wrong?!  Hot steamy and a cowboy!  A little too short but yet good story.  Readable in a few hours.,4,1
"This was my first tread into Jules Verne. I was rewarded with a good read. The only complaint was that there was a lot of detail put into all the different mechanisms they had to make. However, it was still interesting to learn such things from the way to build many things from raw resources to how to create makeshift items to help with survival.The story begins with 5 prisoners; an engineer, a sailor, a reporter, a servant, and a young man along with a very bright dog; traveling in a hot air balloon to escape imprisonment during the Civil War. They are thrown onto an island that isn't listed on any maps and well out of the way for any ships in the Pacific to go by. They even go on a short trip to a close but un-useful island to help a castaway. For four long years these escapees have to start from nothing to make themselves a civilized dwelling. They create everything from a house in granite rock and a garden and an animal farm to any mechanism they might need to create something to survive with. They spend their days working and building and creating all the necessities as well as some wants. They build two ships and at the last second when they fear death, they are saved. There are references to 20,000 leagues under the seas and captain Nemo as well as historical things.The story is long but with all the details you learn not only to feel like you know the islanders but also enough to see their surroundings and feel their anxieties. There is adventure, camaraderie, pirates, survival, and many other things all wrapped up in this amazing classic.",4,1
"I really liked this book. It was very well written and the story was immediately engaging. I have to admit that I really hesitated to purchase this book due to the cover. I have become so disgruntled lately with a lot of the junk that is out there. Needless to say, I am very happy that I purchased this book.The story was very good, though I have to admit all the fighting and life/death situations did become tiresome toward the end. The characters were very believable and Wulf was a HOT! HOT! HOT! Alpha male. Very possessive and protective and did I mention HOT? His growling did become ridiculous and I laughed at how often it was mentioned. Waaaay too much - though I like some growling.I really liked reading about a kick butt alpha female who wasn't about to fall into bed with the hero just because of biology and I loved it when she ran away from him forcing him to chase after her.  It was very entertaining and then, damn it, she decides to give in to him with no further effort on his part. I enjoy a story where the hero has to work HARD to secure his woman and sadly, this element seems to be missing in so many romances. There was some of that here but not near enough, in my opinion.Overall though, this was a great book by a talented author and I do recommend it. If you like science fiction romance, with a hot alpha, you will like this book.",4,1

"Reading the reviews before purchasing this, the first in the series, I was shocked at the negative responses.  I have always enjoyed Bianca's work, so it was out of character to see such reviews.Based on my past experience with her work, combined with my love of dragons, I decided to give the series a shot.  Granted, there is a lot of sex, but this is to be expected for the genre Bianca writes in.  This is an adult romance story & not for kids, which I read as a complaint in a few of the reviews.  How anyone could think otherwise, I have no idea, as it's obvious in the description this book contains sexual situations.Also, many reviewers commented on dragon-human sex.  I did not see this at all, rather the dragons matings affect their human-bonded warriors; I saw nothing untoward about this.  The reviewers made it sound as if the dragons and humans were having sex.  Nothing could be further from the truth.If you know this is an erotic story, with frequent sexual scenes, then you should know what to expect.  As for the story, I found I enjoyed the characters.  The dragons had a surprising amount of humanity, which I enjoyed.  The warriors were strong, capable, sexy men.  There were a lot of sex scenes, no question.  I would have enjoyed the story a lot more if there was more to the story than sex, as not much occurred beyond their meeting and mating until the very end.Bianca has always had wonderful world and character building, with a great plot.  This story lacked the complexity of her normal writing for me, thus the three star rating.  Other than this, I found the reviews to be unfounded.The best advice I can give regarding this story is, if you have enjoyed this Author's writing, you will likely like this, more for the potential as a continuing series than for this story specifically.  If you have no experience with this Author, I would recommend not judging all of her work based off of this story.  Her work, as a whole is incredible.As an Author myself, I know we don't always hit a home run.  It's not a bad story, it's simply not her best work.  However, I am excited for the future of this series, as I see the potential exists for amazing stories to come.  As I write this review, I believe she is on the seventh book of the series.I would suggest, if it sounds interesting, or like something that may interest you, give it a try.  Do not let the negative reviews alter your opinions of the Author, her work as a whole, or this story in specific.  To do so would be an injustice to a very creative and successful Author.As for me, because I see the potential in the series, I will purchase the next book and see for myself.  I have faith in this Author's writing abilities enough to spend three dollars and change for a chance to see where she takes the series.Also, there were several remarks made of the positive reviews being made all by paid reviewers.  To clarify, as an Author we do not pay reviewers, or pay for reviews.  People who review books are provided with an ARC (advanced reader's copy) so they can read & review prior to publication date.  This is done for many reasons, some being for the benefit of the reader (so they have an opinion to read on a new book), others for the Author (so they can get first-hand feedback early on from people who do nothing but read in their genre).Making an accusation of paying for reviews is harsh, unfounded and discredits the Author, reviewer, and the entire process.  We have no need to pay for reviews, and it would be a vast waste of (what little) resources and time we have.  After all, when the book hits the market, if the reading public does not like it, no amount of positive reviews from reviewers will change this.Also, I would like to point out the fact that most Authors have no say in which reviewers their book is sent to, as this is often a decision made and completely handled by the publisher.  As an Author, I am given so many copies of my book to distribute, but these are used for promotional purposes only (like a contest).  I am not allowed to distribute these books to reviewers.  This is in my contract.  So, to this end, making a claim of paying for reviews again has no foundation.I know this explanation has nothing to do with the story itself, but I felt it necessary to clarify, based off of some (poor) reviews, and their comments.  Especially given, if your profession is not that of an Author, you would likely not know how reviewers are handled.In ending, I'm off to purchase the next in the series; I know Bianca's writing, and I am confident she will take this series in great directions.Enjoy!  =)Shelbie Knightwww.shelbieknight.com",3,1
"Reads more like the author copied and pasted his notes and called it a book. No regard for grammar, punctuation or sentence structure and author slips from 1st to 3rd person at several points. Appears to be a rough draft of a middle school research paper than an actual story.",1,0
I really liked it but it should have been longer.. I didn't want to stop reading this.I can't wait to read more,5,1
"A short story that was interesting to read. I think it could have been made into a longer story, but it worked well the way it is. A story of sacrifice, and finding out how to make the best of what you have.  There are enough details to give you a good idea of the world this is set in and the characters are developed decently for a short story, not excellently, but decently.",4,1
"Why ruin a good book with sex scenes?This was a hard book to read, but that was to be expected- it's very depressing subject matter.  It was well handled, though, fairly well written for the most part. I would give it a 3 or 4 star rating, if it wasn't for the 2 sex bits. They didn't fit the rest of the story, and pulled me out of it completely. Unnecessary, ill-suited to the story. If not for that, this would have been a good story from a unique viewpoint.",2,0
"I can' give it more stars because Frost uses my God' name offensively - sadly all too common these days, even in children's books.Some crude language, but I guess many writers feel that acceptable, too.On a more positive note, I believe the writer has come up with a human hero, an almost credible plot ( you don't want it too credible, do you!) and lots of action. Although the storyline goalposts seem to keep changing and the ending a bit sudden and far-fetched, I am sure many readers will enjoy the ride. Lots of twists and a few subplots - one being a royal red herring. I would have given more stars for a 'cleaner' version of this story.",2,0
"This was such a touching story about my favorite BDB couple, Zsadist & Bella. I just discovered the Black Dagger Brotherhood series about a month ago, and I've gone through all the books. I'll be reading this one again while I wait for the latest BDB book to come out (in about a week).",5,1

"I find this one a little bit much.  This gal has erotic dreams that are off the chart about a guy from high school.  He has gone from the all-American football player, popular guy to a CEO that is wealthy beyond words.  One day he walks into the store where she is working, a retail store that sounds like a grocery store discount dollar store combined.  Not high end.  He asks her out and she agrees.  He tells her he will send his assistant to pick her up and take her out for a dress to wear, etc.  He does and she is impressed.Later, he tells her he had a crush on her in school and has never got over it.  She is so insecure that she believes none of it.  He is ready to do anything to get her to consider he is a good guy and he wants to be with her.  Now, she is still having all these wild erotic dreams about him but she hesitates to even hold his hand.  He has got to work to win her trust over a two week period.  He is willing to do anything, including move slow.  So she nearly kisses his brains out and is humping him in his limo but then when he sleeps over it has to be with him keeping his jeans on as they sleep in her twin bed.I'm just having a hard time believing this whole scene.  Plus she is getting on my last nerve.  She is poor, we get it, she is impressed with him and all he has but she can't get into the fact that he actually likes her.  I gave up.  The heroine just got on my last nerve.  I really couldn't understand why he wanted to put so much energy into winning this girl over when she seems to be happy right where she is.

"Okay, I started and stopped this book several times mainly because the editing is horrific. I don't even know if it was edited at all. There were grammatical errors, misspelled words and words in the wrong order. The book at times seems to be written from the first, second and even third point of view and the Kindle version even had different fonts alternating throughout. All of this took away from the story and the mistakes got even worse the closer you got to the end of the book.The plot seemed undeveloped. The heroine:Kat saw her mother murdered and was sent, by her father, to be raised by her uncle in the hopes that he would keep her safe. Why she was safer with him was never explained. She meets a boy: Kenji and falls in love with him. Kenji goes away, but years later Kat is reintroduced to him and told she must marry him per an agreement both of their families had made when they were born. The premise is that they both have powers which are to be used to fight evil. There is a Japanese mob and other villains who want to find a way to use their powers to rule the world.(insert evil laugh here).The story reads like a Scooby Doo mystery from that point on. Kenji is a secret agent and has a team of agents backing him, the entire climax of the story was filled with the team, including Kat, her uncle and a few other family members fighting scores of assassins and ending with ***SPOILER ALERT***  Kat and Kenji using their power to kill all of the assassins at once. Which begs the question, if it was that easy, why not do that in the first place.The villains are only described by their physical appearance throughout most of the book and only at the end are they named, not that we would have known them anyway since the book does not go into detail about them at all. There was a lot of description regarding what kinds or cars everyone was driving, what kinds of watches, earrings and shoes Kenji and his crew were wearing, all of which was unnecessary. The story was based in Atlanta and the Georgia mountains, which seemed odd for a Japanese ninja fight. Also the hero was described as being a traditional Japanese Samurai but several times said slang terms which seemed out of character. To the authors credit, she did have Kat to question him on it, but it was still out of place. There were more character inconsistancies I could name but this is already rather wordy and I think you get the point.There was a very obvious secondary romance thrown in as a set up for a sequel. Lets hope the author has time to hone her craft and the second story will be more put together.",2,0
"The complete works of Jules Verne for a pittance and portable at that.  I am a very happy KIndle Fire user and I've not read Verne but I know of his work and of course the several movies.  I've started 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea the font is clear the language is a little antique but perfectly understandable - it's not the Canterbury Tales.  I frankly find the older style charming.  Very good buy.  I don't have piles of books to contend with.  I can carry all of this around with me.  It is almost too good to be true.  Also have Edgar Rice Boroughs complete works which could use a little editing but nothing too egregious also a very good read if you like old pulp fiction.  It doesn't hurt that I have a wireless network at home the downloads are really pretty transparent for me.",4,1
"I was excited at first. The first starts with a girl named Robyn who is strong and outdoorsy who also happens to be deaf. She is arguing with her brother letting him know that she can go on a trip all by herself. I already liked her. Then, the story takes a shift in to fast, skippy, and lacking luster. The plot goes sour when she runs into two wolves who tell her she's one. She willingy accepts it, accepts that she's the mate of one, and then they have lots of sex where she goes places she's never been willingly. This once fiesty, independent girl became a willing dependent in a matter of a page turn. It was written ok, but the plot went out the window once she got to the cabin. Beyond that, it goes boring and then ends with a girl who on her first night is going to have sex in wolf form in front of the whole pack with her new mate she's known all of a week. I'd say that the girl lost her mind in the woods mostly. Hopefully the writer will get more inventive and risk lengthening the story in order to give more depth to the plot.",2,0
"When her boyfriend calls at the last minute and blows off the vacation she was so looking forward to, Cassandra Devon quickly reevaluates both the relationship and her plans. She dumps the boyfriend, packs her bags, grabs a bunch of the classic books she loves - wildly adventurous and swashbuckling romances that never fail to sweep her away from her average life - and heads to San Diego to meet up with her best friend Valerie. Nothing would please her more than to spend a couple of weeks of fun, friendship, and relaxation. And, of course, reading. Lots and lots of reading.When she gets off the plane and hooks up with Valerie, she comes face to face with the ruggedly handsome but perfectly annoying Connor, the best friend and business partner of Val's cousin Raphael. He's everything Cassandra would never go for in a man. Raphael, on the other hand, is just what she's looking for. He's all things swarthy and genteel, and so gorgeous he looks like he just stepped off the cover of one of her beloved bodice rippers. And she's thrilled when Raphael seems to be equally interested in her.In fact, Cassandra would be contentedly planning her HEA with Raphael if it wasn't for the odious Connor. Not only is he rude, he's got boundary issues - the sort that have him waltzing into her room when she's in the bath, then not having the decency to respect her privacy when she gets out. Then he's all with the kissing and sparring, challenging her at every turn, getting her blood up. The fiend.The longer her vacation continues, the more Connor gets under her skin, until she's practically spitting at him every time he shows up...which is all the time. Problem is, all that conflict has Cassandra questioning her own preferences. Could it be that the hero-type she thought she wanted can't hold a candle to the bad boy she can't help but need? Or is Cassandra's HEA destined to never escape the pages of a book?~*~After the past couple of books I've read left me yearning for some romantic comedy, I needed Lavey'sRipping the Bodiceto cleanse my reading palate and lighten my spirits. It was partially successful in that it's a relatively harmless and humorous romance that made me chuckle out loud in a few places, but it didn't appeal quite as much as I was hoping. I can't say the fault lies with the story, exactly. It's just, as I was reading, I realized I'm not a big fan of bodice rippers. That was a problem because I had a hard time relating to the character who seemed to turn nearly every moment of her life into a scene from one.Instead of being amused by the tongue-in-cheek, exaggerated fantasy life of Cassandra, I was overwhelmed by the number of times the book slipped into italics and flounced around with long scenes of purple prose and over-indulgent scenarios. A few here and there with much shorter length would have been sufficient to make the point and keep the pace of the contemporary romance development from floundering. Not to mention that the scenes took page space from the much-needed character definition and plot development. As a result, too much of the book failed to dip beneath surface issues and conflicts and remained two-dimensional.That was a shame, because there really wasn't anything wrong with what was there outside of Cassandra's dream world. The characters were likable, Cassandra was quirky with a hint of snarky steel that I enjoyed, and there was genuine chemistry between Connor and Cassandra from early into the book. I can't ask for too much more than that. But that's exactly what I feel I got...too much more than that.I didn't mind the predictability of the plot. I wasn't expecting any new ground in romance fiction to be laid with the book so the fact that a reader can see the end coming from a fair distance away didn't bother me. The irony is that the parts of the book that went awry for me were the unexpected parts; the dream sequences, if you will, that didn't appeal. By the end of the book it felt like I'd skimmed a good half of its content to avoid the escalating fiction-within-fiction scenes. As a general rule, that's not a good way to feel satisfactorily entertained.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",3,1
"I guess I'm the odd man out on this book.  How much bad luck can happen to two people?  It started off funny, but then it was kind of overkill for me.

"I received a complimentary copy of this book in order to review it. That's the main reason I finished reading the book. Actually, I'm not sure if Manual Interpretation needs an editor/proofreader or a co-writer. The plot has potential, although it's sometimes hard to follow due to formating problems (a space between points of view would have helped immensely). Plus, I found the changing between first and third person narration annoying. And there were a number of typos. Many of the characters were interchangeable. The only one I found interesting was the Ullumff captain, and he didn't make his appearance until late in the book. In short, there are many books more deserving of Kindle memory space than this one.",2,0

I love Janvier. What's there not to love? He's funny, smart, strong, and gorgeous. Their love hate relationship is kinda fun, too.

"Neglected as a child and subjected to countless disappointments, Jessica Evans doesn't want to believe in either love or relationships.  Determined to keep true feeling at bay, Jessie uses m&eacute;nages with her best friend Clancy and other men as a safety net.  She can enjoy the dominance she craves in the bedroom, but on her own terms.  But Jessie's safety net is torn away from her when Wade Peterson asks her to marry her.  Though she turns Wade down, Jessie still can't get him out of her mind.  And if the struggle to tamp down on her feelings for Wade wasn't hard enough, Jessie's past soon resurfaces with additional complications that unsettle her hard won control.Wade is crushed when the woman he loves rejects his marriage proposal.  However, the sexy-as-sin cowboy isn't about to give up so easily.  He might be willing to share Jessie with Clancy to keep her, for now, but the desire to have Jessie only for himself soon becomes too much.  Will Wade be able to win Jessie's trust and show her that true love and happily ever afters can exist?Mackenzie McKade does it again!  Bound by the Past is an emotional, engaging, sensual read I could not put down.  Wade is meltingly sexy, patient, dominant, and loving - the epitome of the perfect hero.  In the hands of a lesser author I might have become frustrated with Jessie and her determination to stay distanced from Wade.  However, Ms. McKade made me understand Jessie's fears and sympathize with her.  I adored her and loved watching her grow into someone who was able to accept love and give it in return.  As for Clancy, Jessie's best friend and the third in the couple's threesomes, he has me crying out for his story.  He's kind but tormented, supportive of his friends but in need of someone to love him and help him overcome his own past.Bound by the Past is the second in the Ties That Bind series, but can be read as a stand alone.  There is a brief mention of the hero and heroine of the first book, Bound for the Holidays, but having not read that book (yet), I don't feel I missed anything for this particular tale.  I dearly hope Ms. McKade continues this series with books for Clancy and Wade's siblings.At turns tender and titillating, Bound by the Past is a book I Joyfully Recommend.  Ms. McKade delivers a fantastic, blazingly hot tale with characters that will capture your heart and a romance that is truly sigh worthy.Shaynareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",5,1
I loved that Megan's got a mate...it was a needed end to a series. The angst of her journey was well written if a little more intense than I liked. I would've let Lex beat the snot out of him! Because  Shane was not any kind of alpha hero but a selfish self-centered snotty momma's boy. Lauren did not ease me into liking him...he was spoiled and shallow from the beginning as a written character and she never corrected that impression thru his words and deeds ...so the end came and I didn't believe in the change of heart. Megan ...and the series as a body of work... is the only reason this one gets even 3 stars. Warning: the hero is a good looking wuss!,3,1

"This story was just honestly silly to me.I went into this story with such huge and high hopes. I mean it is not really that often you get a really great Dragon shifter story, an erotica one at that. Well, this was yet again not one of those good ones. In the vain attempt to not make this ranty, because I honestly have no reason to rant, I got it for free so it would just perpetuate the cycle of silly to rant about this short story. Which, to be honest, I have read so many great ones recently I was bound to come across one I didn't really like that much. So in that respect I'm going to say what I liked and what I didn't like and be as respectful as I can to the author.What I liked-I like Rajah. He was a great Alpha male and he really fit into the environment and the world that was created. It was supposed to be other worldly with an old world flare. With the way he talked and his attitude he fit. The concept was honestly a great idea. If you were to run with the general idea and mould it in the proper fashion it had amazing potential. The whole idea that there are Dragon shifters and they will snatch up you're pretty virgin butt if they sniff you out is just hot. The sex was honestly rowdy and downright dirty, she didn't hold back and I liked that. The words were raunchy and I was like ""MEOW!"" I wanted to blow my own flames.What I didn't like-With that being said we get down to the basics of why this short fell short. First off, the story is named after the female lead and she was migraine inducing. Larkspur is a `dolphin' shifter and a virgin, though you could have fooled me. The girl acted offended by being pawed at for a total of 3.5 seconds before she was naked spreading her legs. Yes, I get it's a short and you have a word count you are required to work with, but did she have to talk like a girl from the Valley in Southern California? Honestly, it didn't work for me. The moment Larkspur saw his `manhood' she changed. Her dialogue became unbelievable for the old world setting and she just said the daftest things. She ruined the story for me to be honest. When you use the term ""Well you do have a yummy looking c*ck."" And then have her spread her legs out, a supposed virgin that also doesn't feel any pain when said dragon man slides into her HARD mind you HARD! Make it just a little bit believable please!!!!!Needless to say I don't think I will be running out to get her other books based on this world, though I am curious if she runs the same theme with the women that are just so horribly unappealing.  I feel that this is a rant, I'm sorry that this is a rant but I was in bed reading this at 12am just going `Really! I stayed up for this!' I think I was just far too excited about it.",2,0
"This story was over before it started. The story starts off with this queen who has so many traitors in her midst and the guy is on top of that list.

"After reading the other readers reviews I think I might have a different impression of the book had I read the prequel to this story.  However, as it stands, I am left wondering where the HEA in this story is.  I must admit that threesome stories are not my cup of tea because I always feel someone is getting the short end of the stick and it is usually the h.  In this one the h definitely got left with a toothpick size stick.  (SPOILER)  She is left with a husband that IMO is not all that spectacular.  The guy hands her out without talking to her first or taking her into consideration at all.  He seems completely self-absorbed during the entire book and then doesn't even defend her when she is called a b***h.  This author is a real hit and miss for me and this one was a miss.  I wish that the h would have left her husband and find someone to cherish her.  Isn't that what romance is about?  Geesh!  If you want to read a threesome book where all the characters were on a more leveled out playing field I would recommend Laid Bare (Lauren Dane).",2,0
"Apparently I have a thing for dragons, and there aren&#8217;t even any shifters in here, go figure! I was actually pretty surprised at how much I liked the plot of Maiden Flight. A lot of the story was world building, character introduction, and crazy hot m/f/m sexytimes. This is my first m&eacute;nage a trios read so it&#8217;s exciting to get something new under the reading belt. Being a short kindle freebie I was pretty satisfied overall. I&#8217;ve read some reviews that mention how similar this is to Anne McCaffrey&#8217;s Dragonriders of Pern series and I can&#8217;t comment on that because I haven&#8217;t had the chance to start her books yet. I can do some similarities between authors and the worlds they create but I really don&#8217;t like copycats, just saying. I hope I don&#8217;t find out in the future that it was a little too alike for my tastes&#8230;The storyline concept was actually really interesting if not a little over-the-top. The dragons are intelligent, fierce, and very loyal warriors. They are matched with a human knight that they can telepathically communicate with. But the bond doesn&#8217;t stop there &#8211; the dragons are unable to mate until their knight counterparts find their mate first. Why, might you ask? Well knight and dragon have such a unique bond that they can actually feel what the other feels. So in other words the dragon sex drive is so strong that it would drive their knight insane if they had no mate to run to. This exceptional fact made all the sex scenes pretty fascinating. If there was human sex, there was sure to be dragon sex involved as well, and vice versa. This I could handle. The insta-love on the other hand I had an issue with.I mentioned in a previous review that I used to absolutely adore the idea of love at first sight. It&#8217;s such a dreamy and romantic idea that I still sometimes like to daydream about it. But reality and reading well-paced romantically involved books has shifted my judgment. I find myself actually cringing and rolling my eyes pretty far in the back of my head when insta-love hits a heroine and/or hero. Sadly in Maiden Flight&#8217;s case the couple (and the third-wheel!) gets hit pretty hard. Now of course once I got my eyes to focus in their proper position I just accepted the fact that it was part of the story. After that I could enjoy most of what was going on.  I actually enjoyed the romantic situation between the heroine&#8217;s mother and her perspective beau. It was slower-paced and much more realistic.Although there wasn&#8217;t much of a plot to be found I still enjoyed the book. I liked Maiden Flight so much that I went ahead and bought the next couple of books to see how the story progresses. I am hoping the sex scenes become a little bit more creative and the characters get more fleshed out. I&#8217;m hoping for more of the plot to come to the forefront about the war going on, the politics within the Lair, and I&#8217;d like to see more interaction between the characters. I like me some sex but I also like some dialogue, some intrigue, something, anything really. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get some of that with the upcoming books.",3,1

"I really enjoyed this story. Gloria and Landon were adorable together and even though there was an age difference (6yrs), their attraction was believably written. The fact that they shared a history worked for the story and made their 'coming together' even more special. This is a straight shot. There are no twists, turns or surprises. Gloria and Landon meet (again) when she walks into his gym looking to get back into shape after an ugly divorce. He remembers her as the tutor who pushed him to succeed and who he had a major crush on. She doesn't remember him at first...then he smiles.  There follows a short wooing period, he meets her son and her mom, they do the horizontal tango, profess love and the story ends. It is a nice read but it is what it is - a short story.  It is in no way, shape or form worth $7.00.  I would say $2.00 max.  I read it for free; if I'd paid full price there would be hell to pay.  If you get it for free and are just looking for a short, sweet love story you won't go wrong with this. If you plan on paying full price be warned, it is very short!",4,1

"Second in a series featuring those hot, 6'5"" blond god twins Kasey and Garret Johnson, this one centers on rapidly rising movie star, openly gay Garrett.  He begins this tale on the road in Charlotte, North Carolina where he is to be tutored in the art of NASCAR driving (for an upcoming role) by CJ Lamont, one of the leading riders on the circuit, a beautiful and privately tortured soul who is struggling with his marriage because of his hidden secret--he's gay.  Like its predecessor Out of Bounds, this one is far more believable in 2014 than it might have been when first published in 2009, but it is nonetheless an extraordinarily researched and brilliantly developed love story with holdover characters from the first book playing crucial roles.  This one gets into gear smoothly, builds energy around every wild turn, and finishes with a tremendous burst of speed so that we can all relax when the gang crosses the finish line.",5,1

"I normally like books that deal with BDSM, even when they are rather intense.  This book, however, went too far and crossed the line for me.  It was so focused on pain (for the sub, not the Dom) I couldn't finish it.Doms can't play BDSM games without a submissive.  (You can't lead without having followers!)  So why do so many Doms insist on hurting their subs??  I still don't understand that.  And this Hero (he's a hero??--I'd hate to see what the bad guy is like!) went much too far in hurting her!I know this is a work of fiction, not real life, but can the writer not come up with something better?  There are too many battered women out there in real life who associate pain with love.  And the two don't equal each other!I don't like judging a writer's entire body of work on one novel because anyone can write a bad book.  But I won't download anything from Cyna Kane again.",1,0

"I don't profess to be a writer, but I did pay attention and got A's in English way back when - the author had a good idea for a story and I did finish it against my better judgement.  I found myself skimming and omitting about 95% of the ""had's"" - There was way too much he had, she had, they had, it had - Oh my goodness - I've HAD it!.  I was so confused most of the time as to which tense the author was writing.  She would skip from past to present and back to past continually.  Whew - glad it was free and I will not read her again.  Don't know how this got past the publishers - perhaps a self publish.",2,0

Just not my cup of tea. Sorry.",1,0
"I wouldn't have exactly called this a prequel because it's only a breath width's in relation to the rest of the series. It's not a bad story on its own.  I got this one in late 2009 for free for my Kindle and I just now got to it on my &#34;To Be Read&#34; pile.  It was short enough that I didn't mind the lack of chapter demarcations.  I get ticked when they aren't in longer books at least 4 times the length of this one, but they're nice in books that are 3 times this one's length.  If you like light suspense and a little bit of slap and tickle, this novella might be for you.  If you like other books that are about intrigue or mystery I think you should give this one a shot.  Have at it because I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Just don't expect a hugely fleshed out story for one this short.  I can't wait to read the next one.",5,1

"Do you know you find a book that read once and you just have to read it again and again because it stands out so much and just keeps calling to you, this is what happens every time my eyes run past any of Dana Marie Bell's books.Ruby is such an interesting character; I think her sense of self preservation is kind of muted because when she gets something in her head it immediately comes out of her mouth, even when dealing with the bad guys. I loved when she told the Deranged Darling she had spinach between her teeth that was priceless and calling the vampire, Jaden &#34;Bunnicula&#34;. Leo will have his work cut out for him trying to keep her out of trouble.I felt so bad for poor Jaden feeling like he is so alone because the two people he loves most turn out to be mates :(The characters in this book are larger than life and hook you right in from the very beginning.  Even though this was the fourth time I have read this book I was still annoyed every time I had to put it down and now I feel the urge to go read the next book in the series again.",5,1
I enjoy vintage books and movies so I enjoyed reading this book.  The plot was unusual.  Don't think killing someone in self-defense but leaving the scene and the body without notifying the police or hitting someone in the jaw to knock them out would wash today.Still it was a good read for me.,5,1
"Mr. Liu's idea has some merit, even though living in cyberspace has been done already. However, the dialogue is awkward and there are lines that are lifted straight from cheesy romance novels.

"Not one for very graphic gore I was doubtful when my co-worker said this was a must read if I ever wondered what would happen if two seriously crazy sickos met up. I downloaded it and was intrigued by the concept of why the authors wrote it. It was a fast paced story that left me going ""Ugh, gross, no way..omg""... all the way through it. I am pleased to say I am now a fan of the authors, their ability to yank you into the perspective of their killers is amazing. It was a fast paced read that left me entertained in a very disturbing manner, but entertaining none the less. I recommend this to any who enjoy a nice bit of horror to pass the day.",5,1
"Although the book had lots to say, at times it was to predictable.  I got confused with all of the trials and tribulations of what could have been an outstand book.  The author didn't make really good transitions from one problem to the next.  At some point in a book the hero has to get a brether.  I will read this author again and hope the next book will hold my interest.  I just couldn't get lost in the book.",3,1

"I like old-fashioned westerns and I like to read those by Zane Grey. He is a particularly good writer, and many of his rip-roarin' westerns have rightly become classics. But be aware a goodly number of his books are more ""prairie romance"" than action-packed western, and in these there's often more huff and bluff than gunfire. Many of his books were not set in the ""old west"" of the past but in ""modern"" times, meaning contemporary to when he wrote them; these often depicted a rugged male abiding by a highly developed sense of fair-play and moral integrity (in contrast to the sneaky ""villain"" who did not), a chaste female heroine, misunderstanding, romance, and overall wholesomeness leading to a happy ending. Several works in this collection--though they  may be set in the western states--are not what we would normally call ""westerns,"" and others are baseball stories and nonfiction accounts of fishing and camping. Sadly the majority of his greatest westerns are not yet inexpensively or freely available in public domain editions. No matter what he wrote (prairie romance, baseball stories, fishing accounts, or classic westerns), Grey knew how to tell a good story, and his vivid descriptions are second to none.UPDATE 05-08-13: You may wish to compare this set of 26 to another Zane Grey collection recently published by Wildside Press as ""The Zane Grey Megapack."" Attractively formatted and offering 42 novels and stories for only $.99, that now seems like the better deal.",4,1
"""Tempt Me"".  Carrie rejects wealthy James' proposal of marriage.  Instead she goes into wine country with her best friends Rose and Vanessa.  In Napa she meets winemaker Tyson who to her delight and shock she wants to join in his ""cave"".""Taste Me"".  Though dumping Elliot at a monster truck rally, Rose feels good about herself and her voluptuous build as she relaxes at the Napa Valley Hotel and Spa.  When she wins the grand prize of a private cooking session with renowned Chef Jack, it is not food they crave when they meet.""Touch Me"".  Vanessa sees a painting that she wants to buy, but Sam the artist refuses to give her money for it.  Instead he demands much more from her as he knows instantly he must paint her.  He asks for three days to paint her portrait and in return the painting is hers.  What he hides from her is that he knows he has found his lifetime muse even if she denies love exists; he has three days to persuade her otherwise.These are three terrific erotic romances starring full blooded (well the males in many scenes have the blood rushing to their lower heads) characters who turn this into a Bella delightful compilation.Harriet Klausner",5,1
The movie prompted me to buy the book which I found quite engrossing for the first half.  I managed to read on for about a qrt of the 2nd half then gave up as the story theme became repetative.  A younger reader would most probably stay with it to the end.,3,1
"In Blurred Nights Marc is Blake's sire to become a vampire. Blake is a unique vampire in the world where they join humans to fight the demons that come from the earth to kill humans and spread terror. The immature Blake finds fighting demons a game, although a deadly game, while Marc is committed to the ancient ideas that vampires were put on earth to protect and help humans.The conversations full of wit between the two vampires, the underlying love for each other that they will not express in words and the competition for the attentions of the beautiful human woman fighter, Kate makes this a great story. Blake keeps coming up with new ways to keep the story flowing and interesting along with the well written sex scenes as they keep hunting the demon's breech.The author supplied me with a copy of this manuscript with no request for a review; the opinions expressed are my honest opinions. If you like paranormal and vampires, this is a very good story that I highly recommend.",5,1
"Ryan has grown tired of his boring life but from out of the blue he begins receiving dirty messages from M. At first, he isn't sure if he should feel excited or concerned. After a session of phone sex, he is more than willing to meet at a motel the next night.To say this short story is Penthouse Forumism is an understatement. I love erotica as much as the next person but this story left me feeling like M is just a big ol ho. If the whole purpose of the story was porn then it was spot on.My advice is not to go into this story expecting anything more than graphic sex scenes. I gave it two stars simply because it was the best erotica from a male author I have read.",2,0
I was hooked right from the start on this one. Its such an intriguing world. There is a really great cast of characters and the romance is fun and hot. I liked the slow build up trying to seduce Kate. This was also my first M/M and it was very tastefully done. I have just never gotten into it before but Marc and Blake just click so well and adding Kate to the mix just makes it even better. I can't wait to read more in this world.,4,1
This is a great story about a woman who is abducted by aliens and basically treated like a wild animal and eventually a sex toy for her Master.  This definitly has age play aspects and harsh punishments. But boy is it a fun to read how the two main characters interact and eventually have feelings for each other other than Master/Pet.,5,1
"I'll start by saying this is the first of four books so I wasn't expecting it to &#34;conclude&#34;. It centers on 3 children, Alex and his younger brother Argus, and Alex's friend, Sapphire. They find a name on a bus map that they can't find and so the mystery starts. Well written with good character development although lots of room still for more.It's quite a short book so I will be moving onto book 2 swiftly.",3,1
"Enjoyable writing and a good story, but too short for the plot.  A longer story would have been smoother and more believable.",4,1
"But I never got too engrossed in it either. I was never bored by this novel. I liked the historical setting for this detective solving murder tale. Decent writing, so-so plot development. All said & done I'd probably try another effort by this author, just wouldn't pay top dollar or buy it if I had any other proven author/series as alternative.",2,0

"I can not tell you whether this novel had a decent plot, exciting mystery, believable characters, or  a good conclusion. This is because I never got to the conclusion. In fact I never got to the end of the first chapter. The reason being that I have a very strong bias considering the writing. Having four letter words on almost every page I read was a total and complete distraction which caused me to be unable to concentrate on the story. Eliminating all such words (which do nothing to the telling of the story) might make it possible for me to read the novel - and judge it on the normal merits of a book.I rated this novel 1 star only because Amazon would not allow me to give it a zero.If I could have gotten through the book I most likely would have rated it higher. It's a real pity the author deemed it necessary to insert all those totally unnecessary four letter words.",1,0

"I read the first two chapters of this book and was nearly sick. I removed it from my Kindle and want to delete it forever and tag these authors to never get another book by them. The book should come with a Super R rating. I rushed to make sure that I hadn't actually paid for it and was glad at least to see that it was free. But as another reviewer wrote: I'd pay to unread those two chapters. There is a difference between mystery writing (I'm a huge fan of Sandford, who deals with some sick bad guys) and this kind of horror. I put it up there with the Saw movies--which I wouldn't watch if someone paid me a million bucks.So, yes, be warned, but think seriously about whether or not this kind of super-sick-violence is something you ever want in your brain.",1,0
"I am thankful that this book was free because I just downloaded it to read.  One page only and it says ""this title is out of print"".

"Opening line: ""The long, wet spring had finally turned the corner into a Connecticut summer so glorious that the residents of Old Wethersfield decided among ourselves it had probably been worth the wait.""The protagonist, Kate Lawrence, and her daughter, Emma, are out for a walk, watching the swans in a local pond, chatting about their immediate plans. Kate snaps photos of the swans - two parent swans with their four little cygnets - to document their progress.Kate is co-owner of MACK Realty and Emma, a paralegal, is launching a real estate law practice with a friend. The morning walk mixes business with pleasure. Mother and daughter admire properties as they hike ""the loop"" where ""nearly every Cape Cod, Colonial, Victorian and farmhouse along our route shone with fresh paint and liberally applied elbow grease.""So what can go wrong on such a glorious summer morning? The answer waits in Kate's office. Someone has sent her the stinking bud of a corpse flower and a clipping about the plant's anticipated flowering at the end of June. The anonymous gift is wrapped in a sheet of paper with scribbling in the margin: ""It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you. And it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink.""The poison pen letter is almost ignored in the confusion that results when a plumber finds a skeleton hidden in an historic house belonging to ""the Henstock girls."" The ""girls"" are the spinster sisters Ada and Lavinia, now in their eighties.By the time the cops arrive, the skeleton has disappeared. It promptly turns up in photos Kate took of the swans swimming serenely in the pond, and the anonymous letter writer strikes again. There's another clipping about the stinky corpse flower and this time the scribbling reads: ""The lovesick, the betrayed, and the jealous all smell alike.""So much for a ho-hum life in the quaint little town of Wethersfield.The poison pen letters seem directed to Kate, who is on the verge of cohabitation with Armando, an attractive South American transplant who is the controller of a telecommunications company. However, the letters could as easily be directed to her two partners: Margo, a southern belle who is in a relationship with a cop named John, and ""Strutter,"" a Jamaican immigrant, whose husband is also named John.Kate is a magnet for trouble. She's tailed by someone driving a black van. The man knocks on her door late at night. Does she call the cops? No, she calls one of her partners and the cops come swarming in. Meanwhile, the plumber who discovered the skeleton in the Henstock house is nowhere to be found - fake ID, non-working cell phone number.And what about those pesky letters? When Kate is mugged in a parking lot, the investigation kicks into high gear.Kate is an amateur sleuth in the tradition of Miss Marple and Jessica Fletcher, attuned to the people in her small town, pooh-poohing any perceived danger to herself, quick to give others the benefit of a doubt.Some minor nitpicks: In one place, Kate's relationship with Armando lasted 8 years; in another it's 7 years; and in yet another she has known him for 5 years. Also, Margo's speech is full of dropped ""g's"" when a couple of instances would have sufficed.This was a comfort read that I hated to see end. Like Kate, I was caught up in the goings-on in Wethersfield, curious about the skeleton and the fate of the two old sisters and wondering how Kate would adjust to Armando's moving in with her.",5,1

I must say that it was very unusual how the twist of events came about, but not to tell the story all I can say is it is a must read and you will be suprised.",2,0

"Maggie Shayne has written a terrific collection of vampire stories that are all intertwined with each other.  I loved following the lives of Eric, Tamara , Roland and Rhiannon.  The story line of James from child to adulthood was also good.  These stories portray vampires as simply people who live without sun and need blood to survive.  A must read.",5,1
I enjoyed the story and thought it was well done.  While like the other reviewer I didn't care for the foursome the rest of the book was done well.  It didn't fit into Rachel's character in the book who was so hurt and cautious.  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series but not if there are more secenes that seem completely out of place or character.,4,1
"The story was interesting and well written. I would have given it a 3.5 stars due to the fact that Leif seemed to accept the present time and ways almost without question. That was unreal. He should have been shocked or more surprised by the modern times. The first half of the book was great other then what i have said. The second part where they go back to Icland in the 900's past was very sad and hard to read. How he treated Kat was was offending and hard to read. Knowing that time period were barbaric times didn't make it easier to read, this is a fiction book after all even though researched on facts. I overall liked this book and would reccomend it to all interested in time travel romances. Will be starting book two today.",4,1

The mystery is solved easily.  All in all, I was disappointed.",2,0

"The story line was interesting enough to keep me reading to the conclusion.  My initial interest was due to the location.  I have personally lived through several Panhandle Blizzards, also near Amarillo, TX.  However, the amount and quality of the sex was way overboard and really turned the entire book into more science fiction than anything else.",1,0
"This book has moments where I am briefly interested, but then it loses me just a few pages later. The author means to be mysterious, but the writing just crosses the line into confusing and boring. There is too little detail, and too little action to keep me hooked. I am halfway through the book, and I give up. I will not finish it.",2,0
"I have had this book on my nook for a while now and finally got got around to reading it. For being so short of a story, it was awfully hard to get through. There was a lot of errors in the writing and it was such a distraction from the story because you had to decode what the author was saying. As well as the characters are not that relatablable. Rae is as confused as confused can get. She is kissing everyone and is making connections with every otherworld person she comes across. The love triangle was unnecessary and really just made you roll your eyes at the book and think ""really?"". There was also a ton of inner dialogue of random babblings that had no huge importance to the story. When I came across a page or two of that, I just skipped through until I got back to the story.The concept was good, a hybrid demon who is brought up ignorant of who she is and is taught to hate those like her. But unfortunately the execution just did not work for me.",2,0
"The title of this review is no reference to the evil doings in the novella's fictional town. Instead it refers to the quality of the work, its length, and the ludicrous price attached to it. Fifty percent of the length of this digital download is dedicated to an interview with the author and promotions of his other work. This betrays the early days of digital books and poor business decision-making in the price/value equation. In terms of the novella itself, it is a terrible homage to Jackson's The Lottery and King's Children of the Corn. After thoroughly enjoying Crouch's Run this was extremely disappointing.",1,0
"This was a good read.  I really enjoyed it.It was well written.  The world is described with  enough detail to really come alive for me but not too much to ever get boring. It was fast paced and there was plenty of action yet at the same time there was a lot of character development where you got to know everyone, especially Marc and Blake.You feel Marc and Blake's love and protectiveness for each other but also frustration, annoyance, disappointment, betrayal, rejection and much more.  They and their emotions feel very real. Marc is more mature and responsible than Blake (and is his Sire) but he has made mistakes in the past which have damaged their relationship. Blake has a lot of insecurities when it comes to Marc. He has  trouble taking anything seriously and has a lot of growing up to do. Even though they are powerful vampires they have some human flaws which make them real.There are plenty of other characters in the story too, most human. Both Marc and Blake fall for Rose as she is not just a pretty face but gains their respect for being such a good fighter. She is a strong independent individual and one of the leaders in her squad. This is new for Blake and it causes him to care for  a human for the first time. This slowly changes him and makes him see things differently. He becomes a better person for it. For Rose the attraction is mutual and she has trouble coming to terms with being attracted to both of them. You're definitely left with the idea that Rose could be what Blake and Marc need to help bring them together and keep them together healing old wounds and bringing excitement and hope for their future.Even though it is clear the story will continue it ends at a good point so the story still feels complete in its own right. I would definitely recommend this story.",4,1
"I enjoyed this book, especially when the price was so low.  My only complaint would be that if you were not paying attention, all this time was passing by from one chapter to the next.  I had to go back and re-read it carefully to figure out that time had transpired from one event to the next.  Story is about Blake and Josephine, who knew each other from when they were teenagers.  She apparently had a crush on him and he never knew.  After highschool, he left the town and became a very rich, successful venture capitalist.  She grows up and becomes a fairly famous model.  Many years later, they run into each other at a party and they are instantly drawn to each other.  They begin to talk and to dance, soon things get heated and they indulge in a passionate one night stand.  After that, Blake leaves her without a word and doesn't attempt to contact her.  Josephine is disappointed and hurt, so when she found out he had gotten engaged, she married his cousin Luke shortly thereafter.Fast forward to a year, Josephine comes home and realizes her husband has left her. Blake goes to her and tells her what his cousin said before running away and she realizes she has nothing.  He took all her money.  Feeling destitute, Blake offers her a job and a roof to stay in.  They begin working together and she soon realizes she is good at the job.  Meanwhile, the attraction is still there and many months go by apparently.  One day they just can't take it anymore and become involved again intimately.  Will thire past get in the way? Will her feelings of betrayal and hurt resurface?  Can they make it into more than a fling?Story moved way too quick for me personally.  Character development was a bit lacking and you had to take things at face value, instead of living it as most good stories do.  Overall, quick and light reading, not in my keep pile.",3,1

"I couldn't ever get into it. I thought this would be fascinating, but the book failed to ever grab my attention.",2,0
"I don't mond reading bad language when there is a purpose for it, however this book has it just to use it without real purpose. I understand that it is the language of the character, but every other word is excessive. I would not listen to a person that spoke that way so I deffinately would not read it. I had an english professor once say, &#34;bad language is used when you haven't the vocabulary to use other words to express yourself.&#34; I also found the dialogue unbelievable. I can see what he author was trying to accomplish with the inner monologue as well as verbal daiologue, but it failed. I couldn't recommend this book to anyone.",1,0
This was a nice steamy read!1 I really liked the story and look forward to more of the series!Flighty feisty heroine meets serious cop! This is a favorite combo for me! I loved the story and there was plenty of adventure besides all the hot steam!,4,1
"I am partial to post-apostoliptic (spelling?)books, movies whatever and in this respect this book was no disapointment.  As a relative unknown author, I admire his courage and stick-to-i-tiveness in this first book of the series.  I nearly quit reading about a third of the way through, but desided to give this guy the benefit of the doubt and finished.  By golly he's doing really well.  He could use a second set of eyes to help him edit typos and such, but aside from that I was glad I didn't give up on the author.  I have read the whole series and enjoyed it.  Fare thee well Mr. Sides; fare thee well.  rsmquilts  R. Sharon McGovern",4,1
"lots of talk, and description, and more talk, and pages describing single conversations. A promising set-up. Poor delivery. The action is at the end and not so much for all the waiting we've done. Torture is bad. Don't punish the readers.",2,0
"For whatever reason, Star Wars short stories are a bit of a hit or miss. The ""Tales of..."" are great in that they explain background characters. However,Fool's Bargaindidn't really fit the bill. It's a short story about a relatively minor and unmemorable character from Timothy Zahn'sSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). The story itself is basically about stormtroopers storming a fortress with some mysterious Warlord. Unlike most of Zahn's other work, this is mostly a book of action, not intricate plot development. In fact, the story ends with an exciting twist, but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love, or included a really interesting plot twist. Also, just to note, this same story is included in the paperback copy ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars), so there's no need to buy the separate Kindle version.",2,0
This book really skipped around. No high and low points and no big drama in the story. I have never been so incredibly bored,1,0
"Tami Dee has created a world of time travel and romance. She skillfully moves the characters from our time to an ancient Norse encampment, and in the process her fun hero and heroine each have to cope with adjusting to a time that is not their own.  This is only the first book - and they keep getting better!  There are a lot of brothers in this family, after all!Mists of Time Book One: Under a Viking Moon",5,1
I'm having a difficult time trying to go through my Kindle Fire looking up these titles to please you. Satisfied,5,1
"This could have been so much better. I don't know anything about this author, so I don't know if it was her first book. If so, she has room to learn and improve.The story idea was decent, some of the writing was good. The execution needed a lot of work. She used far to many adjectives, especially when it came to the eyes. &#34;her eyes shining in awe&#34;, &#34;a mocking look in his eyes&#34;, &#34;with a tortured sigh&#34;. While these types of sentences can give depth to a story, when such descriptive language is used multiple times in each paragraph it gets too flowery.Another issue I have is the cover and title. How embarrassing for anyone to see you carrying this around. It doesn't do the story any justice and could, in fact, scare some readers away. Yes, there are sex scenes. They are definitely not as X-rated as the cover and title would lead one to believe.I got this as a free download and, honestly, didn't know if I'd ever read it since the cover gave me the wrong impression. I'm glad I gave it a chance but feel the author needs to hone her writing skills.",3,1
"This book is good, although it has a lot of sexual language in it. But you have to read the books in order or you don't get the full story.",4,1
"Jayne Rylon is a wonderful writer who can weave an intriguing tale.  I am disappointed in this book.  It is well crafted with plenty of sex and even the situations move a story along.  My conflict with how I feel about the story is the ethics involved in a premise like the one presented in the work.  I don't mean moral ethics,as it is erotica.  I mean scientific ethics that some how are missing here.  I can't say I didn't like it. I can only say that I had a hard time buying the experiment conducted.Yes it is a story in a make-believe world.  Maybe actual studies are conducted in this manner; I just found it difficult to suspend my disbelief.",3,1
The Jane porter series is the one but I actually like the supporting characters in this series a good look into the world of BDSM,5,1
"I cannot believe I paid for this. The story started out fine 15 minutes later the story was over, not only that but the way it ended was so dumb,it was f***up  a waste of minutes of my life.",1,0

"A Turn of Curses is an excellent fantasy novella. The characters are well constructed and believable, allowing the reader to identify with the privileged view of a pampered ""chosen one"" as well as those who must put up with her ignorance. You care about Selina and Faldon; you care that they each fulfill their individual quests. The ending will tug at your heart, but leave you satisfied in the way a fantasy is meant to do. Melanie Nilles is a gifted storyteller! Well done!",5,1
"The Bedroom BusinessThis is one of Sandra Marton's earlier works. I already read this before but I just had to read this again. Jake is Emily's boss. He is ruthless in business. When it comes to his women, although not exactly the love them and leave them kind of guy, he does not allow any of them in his heart. Enters Emily, his personal assistant. A shy and seemingly unattractive woman. When Jake makes it his business to do a makeover for Emily and to teach her how to flirt and how to act on dates, it is a disaster and heartbreak just waiting to happen since both of them eventually realize that they feel something for the other. Funny & romantic. A must read!",5,1
"This story was very short but I expected that since it was free.  Unfortunately, it was also very pat, very rote.  This was a royal princess who had been reduced to slavery.  I found nothing regal about her in her thoughts, words or actions.  There was also the fact that she had not eaten in two weeks.  Really?  She certainly had enough energy to trash her quarters completely and to have sex with a complete stranger.  She seemed quite satisfied after eating an apple and one berry.  That just struck me as completely unbelievable.I'm afraid I skimmed most of the rest of the book.  It consisted mostly of sex and the full-grown Prince grovelling to his parents.  I don't agree really with the others that it ended too quickly.  I think the author wrapped up the story well enough.  They got their happily ever after and set it up to sell another story.I probably wont buy from the author again.  I don't like the H to be weak nor do I like the h to be a slut.  I can't imaging that her other stories will stray much from the basic outline of this one.  I just re-read this review and it sounds a bit harsh.  Unfortunately, I still believe every word so I'll post it as it stands.",3,1
"When I was 13 and haunting the public library one summer, I discovered Zane Grey western novels. The very first one I read was East of the Pecos, and it thrilled me. It had action and adventure, horses which I loved, and told of an Old West where men were men and women were glad of it. The novels had a strong romance subplot -- at least strong according to my newly-minted teen-hood.That one book had me scouring the section where his books were shelved. I can't remember how many I read. Each thrilled me as much as that first one.When I bought my Kindle a couple of years ago, I spent days scrolling through the lists of free books and low-priced ebooks. Imagine my delight when I came across this little gem -- a collection of 26 of Zane Grey's most popular novels and with a Linked Table of Contents. I grabbed it, and started reading.I have to admit that I was totally surprised that the stories still captivated me. I'd thought I might find them as stale as an episode of Gunsmoke on TV Land. Not at all. The stories are still compelling plus I love the American West history in each.After I'd read the first book in this collection, I visited the Texas Ranger Museum in Waco, Texas. Walking through the museum, I realized how accurate were Grey's portrayals of the men who brought law to Texas and to the history of nineteenth century America.This collection is wonderful, and it's worth far more than the modest price. The books are delightful in every way and make one understand why the western was so popular in television and movies for so long.",5,1
"""Her name was Two, and she sometimes thought she could smell her death.""With that opening line we begin the story of Two, whose real name is Ashley Majors. She is a heroin addicted teenage prostitute. It's almost impossible to feel anything but sympathy for her, as the opening scene has her on her hands and knees begging her pimp for her day's ration of  smack. We learn how Two ended up in this house of hell, and she immediately becomes the underdog we all want to win.Two's services are requested by the mysteriously dark and debonair Theroen who shows up to save her in a shiny black Ferrari. He takes her to a swanky Italian restaurant then drives her at breakneck speed away from New York and into the country where, unbeknownst to her, he turns her into a vampire.Life at vampire central, although filled with luxury and priceless antiques, turns out to be anything but fabulous. Enter the villain of the story, a completely nutters master vampire called Abraham. Added to the mix are a Dr. Jekyll/Ms. Hyde vampire named Melissa/Missy and a night walker named Tori that has almost completely regressed to a primal state as a result of the vampiric change.The romantic arc between Two and Theroen does not always make sense. Although I do believe in love at first sight, it would seem an impossibility that Two, as street-smart as she is, would not only fall head over heels in love with someone she just met, but the idea that she would trust him as completely as she does just  doesn't sit well. She should be suspicious of him at the very least for turning her into a vampire without her consent.And, although most of the characters and their relationships with others are well developed, we aren't told much about Abraham, other than that he's as powerful as a god and apparently as mean as a snake.With that said, the story itself was interesting and portrayed vampires as the human-hunting blood-thirsty beasts that I think they should be.As events unfolded, I found myself alternately wanting to praise and throttle the writer. He takes us on roads that we don't expect to travel and the story itself is often the polar opposites of dark and gritty and bright and heartwarming.I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well written tale involving the darker side of vampires. I wouldn't necessarily consider this book to be a paranormal romance, as it doesn't seem that the romantic angle is the prominent plot point. It is important, but the main character's struggles are what's important in this story.I am, without a doubt, looking forward to the sequel.",4,1
This was a very enjoyable story.  Milo and Mya are interesting people that are exciting to learn more about.  The plot was formulaic but the characters are so much fun it's okay that the storyline takes a backseat to their personalities.  This is a quality read that is incredibly priced. Buy it.,4,1
"What an amazing disappointment this short story was.  (And believe me..it's short.)I was hoping for what the product description promised:""a story full of passion, intrigue, humor and good old-fashioned romance""What I got was poorly written smut, cheesy sex scenes and zero plot.  The characters were flat, lifeless and completely drab.  This belongs on an erotica forum site for people to post their sexual fantasies.  It is not even remotely close to being worthy of being called a book, short story, or even ebook!My only consolation comes from the fact that I downloaded this while it was free on Amazon and did not waste my money on this badly written smut fest.Do not waste your time or your money.You will regret it.",1,0
"...with a twist of goth and one seriously bad serial killer!This book really held my interest all the way through, but then the ending came and went in a flash.  With so much build up, I would have thought the ending would take longer to complete itself - not so.The detail given to describe the setting of each scene was incredible.  Also, you were provided deep insight into the characters, even the lesser ones.  There was nothing vague about this book.Formatting was off, but it wasn't too distracting after a while.",4,1
"I enjoyed it. But just lacked something, why do you have to have some many words in these recommendations sometime it was good is enough.",2,0
"REVIEW CONTAINS WHAT MAY BE CONSIDERED SPOILER ABOUT THE ENDINGI think that recently more stories with main characters who have disabilities appeared in mm fiction, but I still hope for more. When I purchased this story, there were not nearly enough. Overall the story was sweet, okay, not nearly enough depth in characterization for me, but ""magical cure"" ending made me want to throw the book against the wall. To say that it was not well researched would be an understatement. I would have given it three stars, but ending made me angry enough to take off another one.",2,0
"This book was very confusing only because Izzy could not hold a thought most of the time, then I realized it was a very unique style of writing that makes you recheck what you read which really puts a spell on you to keep reading.  Hypnotic confusion which really makes this book a stand out with twist and turns and a perfect ending.Then another thought.... maybe Izzy was enjoying Feather's potions and too much wine.The book is truly a good read and well worth going into the woods!",4,1
"I find it hard to put into words. I find these books demanding in a way that means, I cannot relax and just read it. I have to ""work at it"". The story and characters are good. The ""adventures"" demanding and challenging. I feel like I am always ""straining"" to get to the end of the story so I can rest! But then, there is more..another one...and I am curious to see what's next.",4,1
"Carlee was the whiniest so and so that i've ever come across.  She is pissed at Trey because he doesn't remember the past lives they shared.  She takes this to mean that he doesn't care about even though he insists that he wants to have a relationship with her.  She also sites the 2 hour distance between them as a reason why the relationship wouldn't work.  Uh...ok...all the while he begs her to give him a chance.  She refuses and demands that he leave her alone.  He does, but only because of a family tragedy.  She is understandably (NOT) upset that he does in fact leave her alone like she requested and decides to sleep with an ex without protection (her demand).  She ends up pregnant and again says she is the wronged party since Trey isn't immediately understanding that she spread her legs for her ex and got pregnant.  UGH...this book pissed me off so much I had to stop and delete it from my kindle and I NEVER delete books.  Do yourself a favor and save your money on this one.",1,0
This book is a book that could bring some much needed hope to many people whom have lost a love one. I wish that everyone would receive such validating information from their lost love one.,3,1
"This book had promise. It's got themes that could be explored -- aging, widowhood, manic behavior, budding authorship -- but it fell flat fast and never recovered. There are many unnecessary events, no clues to speak of, giant leaps to conclusions told to us rather than unfolding in the story, and totally unexplained how/why regarding at least one of the murders. I knew about a third of the way into the book, I wasn't enjoying it, but hoped there'd be a payoff. I just don't get it... why are there more books in this series?  (Almost hate to give it the one star required)",1,0
She is a favorite author of mine. I've read a lot of her books. Never disappointed.  I often fall in love with her heroes - where can I get one for myself?,4,1
Interesting story. Didn't know who did it till the end and that's always good. I like a little mystery with the love story.,4,1
This one promises to be another good book. I have been reading through the series and have not gotten this far yet.,5,1
"This was a good read, not a great read.  Perhaps I was looking for a little more of the m&eacute;nage sex scenes - it took forever until the lovely Susie was brought into the men's bed.  Then - the angst, sometimes we readers could do without all the angst.  What's wrong with a straightforward good book of a developing relationship - that has enough stress in it, really don't need to add any more.",3,1
"I know nothing about cults, so much is seemingly made up, and worse contrived. Sex references are childish, but still may bother some readers. The ending, which does resolve everything did not seem at all real.",2,0
"Though the description says ""Sister of the Bride"" is 400 pages long,  that is just not possible:  this is a short novella, not a full length book.That said, even for a novella it is eminently forgettable.  There is no tension between H/h, no obstacles to their relationship and it is essentially a boy-meets-girl-and-they-get-engaged story (in an unbelievable 3 days!!!) with no angst and very little to keep the reader's interest.  And there are strange editing issues, as if the author forgot the physical details  of what her heroine looked like.  Overall I think there are better books by Susan Mallery out there and I definitely would not start with this one!",2,0
"It's the end of the world... and I feel fine after reading this. Unfortunately, woman are ridiculously marginalized and I really hope in a crisis that more then one person without testicles could step up and contribute to the creation of a brave new world. Surviving the Fog was a fun guilty pleasure, like a movie of the week on the sci-fi channel... you aren't expecting grand art and you are getting a good time.",4,1
"Don't get me wrong; the premise and story were great, well developed and plausible.  The BIG problem with this book, aside from some Kindle formatting issues, which you can overlook easily enough, was that it was written so badly in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc.I don't think that details regarding what someone does in the bathroom were needed, or one of the accused ""scratching"" himself, or an attorney pleasuring himself, by himself, they were so unnecessary, that they really detracted from the story and simply didn't belong.The title leads you to believe that right from the start there's a vigilante at work.  I was 44% into the book before the first vigilante act took place, so the description of the book is a little misleading.I enjoyed the book, and it gets you interested immediately and keeps you interested throughout the book.  It had twists and turns, most of which were unexpected, but it was incredibly hard to get past the elementary level of writing.  If you're going to write a book that you want people to read and enjoy, and you want those same readers to ""spread the word"" to others, and possibly read additional books you might write, for goodness sake, write it well, turn on spell check and proof, proof, proof.  I was astounded at the poor use of grammer, the use of incorrect words, the punctuation was atrocious, and many times I find that reading books written like this almost make you nauseous.I hate to blast the basic writing style, but it is hard to enjoy a book when these things are rampant throughout the story.  The storyline was good, holds your interest and is a fast paced and interesting read.  If you can get past the poor writing style, you'll really enjoy the books premise.  Thank you for reading my review.",2,0
I really liked the story in this book.  I could not put it down till the very end of the story.Thank you so very much for writing this great story.,5,1
"Woohoo, just added another series to my library list.  This is exactly the kind of books I like:  dominant alpha male possessive over his mate.  Tienan is a trained killer, but he feels a protectiveness towards Silence from the moment they meet.  And of course, the meeting was perfect.  Silence was tracking him to give information to the leader of the Resistance (her adopted brother), but the hunted became the hunter.  And the game is on!!  This was a very good read.  Anyone who likes dark cold mysterious guys who finds that one woman to soften them, will love this story.  Now I'm moving on to the second story in this series.",4,1

"While this book is rather short, I'd love to see it expanded! The characters are engaging and the issues they deal with (life in general) are something we can all relate to. I read this and thought, this is the perfect beach read. It just feels like a summer book! My niece is going to read it next, she is 17 and I think that Twenty-Somewhere would be perfect for her with all the changes she has coming. It also inspired me to look at my own life a bit and think it could use some focus.",5,1

"Sleeping with the boss is a bad idea.  Angela Clarke tells herself this, but can't seem to care when Ryan Tyler wraps his arms around her on the dance floor at the company Christmas party.  His proposition to spend the night with him is definitely much more appealing than spending Christmas Eve alone...  But she never expected the night to include handcuffs, or the unexpected arrival of Ryan's best friend!Ryan's personal policy against fraternization no longer seems important since he hired Angie.  He knows he must have her, at least for one night.  But when sharing her with his best friend rouses uncharacteristic feelings of possessiveness in him, he realizes one night will never be enough...Forget everything you THINK you know about Christmas stories!  I don't care if you say you don't like them, this one is smoking hot!  Truly, the holiday theme is really more of a backdrop for a very sexy and intense romance, complete with a m&eacute;nage scene!While this isn't a story about a m&eacute;nage relationship, the scene serves very well to propel the romance between Angie and Ryan, acting as the catalyst that makes Ryan realize his deeper feelings for Angie.Once again, the readers benefit from Mackenzie McKade's obvious love of cowboys with the supporting character, Wade.  Not only is Wade hot and sexy, but he brings enough of his own story to make readers hungry for a sequel starring the dominant cowboy.I'll say it again, while Bound for the Holidays is classified as a holiday story, no one who reads it will think of it as such.  McKade has penned a steamy contemporary romance that will guarantee satisfaction year round!",5,1
"I exected something a little bitter. The first part was kind of enjoyable, but th second have was awful. The hero, Simon, flirted with the older woman, Cynthia, to keep her in a good mood. But, liked are heroine. If its a romance novel, than the hero should only pay attention to the heroine and not some bags of bones. The writer should just give up writting and never write another book, ever.",1,0

"I read and enjoyed the prequel to this book, Lover Awakened, so I thought I would try this shorter e-pub. It was good!As a new father, Z must come to terms with his past so he can embrace fatherhood, and baby Nella, without fear. Tender scenes with Z, Bella, and Nella. Sizzling sex, too.SPOILER -----I was expecting the visit to the dermatologist / plastic surgeon to end differently. Usually, in most romances, everything gets tied up in a pretty bow, but that gets old. This seemed more authentic.",4,1
This book was done well.  It moves along smoothly and keeps your interest.  The story line is consistent and while there's quite a bit going on in the book everything is brought together in a way that makes sense by the time you get to the end.  This book has some parts that will make you smile at the way situations were handled with all things considered.  Good book.,4,1
"I started reading this book and wondered if the guy would ever get his life straight.  I felt sorry for him, I worried about him and then I was angry that he was making the same mistakes.  As I read more, I started to understand why he was repeating the cycle.  Really it was no different than someone being abused, then dating someone abusive, you do what you know.  The change that this man made, was awesome and the lives he touched.  When I got to the end of the book, I was heart broken that he did not get to do more.  Very good book.",5,1

"The week before she has to marry, in order for her family to buy a new roof, Bridget embarks on a last adventure. Dressed as a boy, she travels with her groom's representant, Ian, to Doom's castle. She soon discovers a smuggle operation, a plan to kill french refugies, escapes (twice) from rape, gets sick, shot at, kidnapped, thrown from a cliff and so on...Amazingly, she still has time to fall in love and is almost (all but) seduced by Ian.I've noticed that the christian litterature reference was removed. I can only wonder why it was ever there. For a well-brought virgin, Bridget is certainly fast, to say the least. There are no christian value anywhere in this novel, from begining to end.Dont't get too excited about the prospect of sexy scenes. Yes, they are frequent, but really boring.The dialogue is so bad, it's actually very funny which is why I gave it three stars. I couldn't wait to see what ridiculous thing Bridget would think, say or do. Taken as a joke, this book is quite entertaining. Otherwise, give it a pass.",3,1
I really enjoyed this story. It had some nice twists and turns which made it very interesting. I would recommend it.,5,1
"The publisher's blurb gives a fairly good synopsis of the story, so I'm not going to waste time rehashing it.  The details are what sunk this book for me.Abby is, for lack of a better term, a hot mess.  She likes having sex with all sorts of people in all sorts of situations, yet she's worried about people thinking she's a slut (her direct quote).  She flips out at Eric when she thinks he's going to ask for a deeper commitment beyond the sex they've been having, but she doesn't have any issues at all in the span of a couple of days agreeing to be in a permanent menage relationship.I know this is more of a short story/novella, but the total lack of meaningful descriptons and character development is ridiculous.  All we know about Eric is that he's horny all the time; Jett is pretty much someone's wishful thinking - a male model who also happens to be brilliant and in his residency stage of medical school; Abby is in a state of unending PMS but she pretty much thinks anything or anybody having sex is ""hot.""  They all have the dimension of a piece of paper.I didn't find the erotic scenes at all interesting.  It was more like, ""tab A goes into tab B and tab C is either watching or thinking about what it should do next.""  Bleh.Kelly Jamieson is a decent author; I've read some of her other work, and this just doesn't do her any justice.  For anyone that might find it objectionable, there are M/M, M/F and M/M/F scenes.",2,0

Brant could be a compelling character, but it was difficult to get much of an understanding of what he was like between the flashbacks and his loneliness.  When his niece is kidnapped by a sex slavery ring, his attempts to get her back draw him into a morass of criminalityFrom the beginning, it felt as if I was reading the same scenes over and over again:  We'd have Brant being all dark, a Vietnam flashback, Kit in danger, Brant fighting with authority figures, Kit in danger, a Vietnam flashback, somebody throwing up, Brant shadowing someone, Kit in danger, someone vomiting, etc.  Too many of the characters felt like empty cliches.

Chick-lit this book is not, but from a chick-porn perspective it is pretty good! This book is short but that is a good thing. I don't need drama with my chick-porn.

"I have really enjoyed this series and this is my first review.i was waiting to see if it could sustain it's pace... Alas, it has slowed down... Books before this one were fast, well written and action packed! This one was wordy, slow and boring. The best part is that it is short. I will continue to read the series and see if the pace picks back up. When I saw how many books were in the series, I thought the author might be stretching it out to cash in..... Confirmed..",2,0
"I love these books.  Yes, they can be a bit too pat at times, the characters pretty predictable, but still... delvers, shags, cliff behemoths, river rogues, hook hawks, and many many more - you have to give credit for creativity where it's due!! I've read my share of fantasy and never come across HALF the creatures in this series.  I particularly enjoy the qualities of the delver!That is the ONLY reason I'm still reading them.  The writing is just atrocious. Then is frequently used for Than. Most compound words are separated: he said so any way, she decided to cook some thing, they rose above ground, etc.  It drives me insane.  There's also a lot of redundancy; the author doesn't seem to have a very large vocabulary (or a thesaurus!!): he remains standing among the remaining guards still, etc.  As you see, repeating the word AND re-stating the concept.  If he remains there, obviously he's there still, so why add it to the end and make it awkward?  Also, many sentences just don't make sense.  Either they seem to be missing words, they seem to have extra words, or they seem unfinished.There are still other grammatical/spelling errors, but this is getting pretty long.  As you can see, those things bother me a great deal. Imagine how interesting this world must be for me to continue reading! I'm currently on book 4, and I've marked 158 mistakes at the 23% mark but am still enjoying it!",4,1
"I once owned the Ace versions of these 3 tales and I enjoyed them when I first read them, gosh, about 50 years ago!  I was happy to be able to re-read them now and, for a little while, recapture my childhood. We all know they are not great literature, but we also know they will provide us with a few hours of pure escapist entertainment. Kline was never as good as Edgar Rice Burroughs, but when you ran out of ERB, Kline was there to help fill the void. This is a very fairly-priced set inasmuch as others are selling the books separately for as much or more. My 5-star rating may be a little inflated--Kline is certainly no Charles Dickens--but I think some earlier reviews were meanspiritedly low. Believe me, you will receive more than a buck's worth of entertainment.",5,1
"I got half way through this book and gave up, but one day I might start again and see if I can bear the boredom",2,0
"The Thinking Machine is--well--mechanical. Talk about formulaic writing! Professor Van Dusen (AKA The Thinking Machine) is an insufferable bore. The police are always too dumb to figure things out. Van Dusen recites to them (in EVERY SINGLE STORY) ""two and two make four. Not sometimes but all the time."" Ah, logic triumphs over all!If you are looking for character development, you won't find it here. The professor is unidimensional and not the least bit endearing. His dimwitted sidekick, Hatch, is always two or three steps behind. The book did have one redeeming quality--it a great help when I had a hard time falling asleep. A few pages and I would be out like a light!  And since the whole thing was summed up in the last couple of pages, you could just cut to the chase and save yourself a lot of time.If you want a good read, try Agatha Cristie (almost ANYTHING she's written), or if you like a hint of the egotistical devotee of logic, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is a better choice--hands down!",3,1
"This book was a quick and enjoyable read.  The Ghost Shrink, The Accidental Gigolo, & the Poltergeist Accountant was a cute short story.  The other stories in this were just excerpts from other stories.  I didn't really care for those because I'd rather either read the whole thing or just a description of the story. I thought this was a good introduction to the writing style of this author and I liked this story enough that I would read other books she wrote.",4,1
This is the first book I read by Deatri King Bey. I like the scenes between Saundra & her sisters. I thought it was cute how Saundra sister tried to hook her up. The storyline really didn't hold my interest & it was kinda corny. I don't know if I would read more books by this author.,2,0
Bravo to the authors for pairing up to do this short story...the concept was interesting...each to their own story and winding down with mingling the two story lines into one fine story in the end. A quick read plus a good lesson there on don't pick up hitchhikers and don't be one either.,4,1

"This book has to be one of my top 10 favorites. I love the Character of Hunt Jamison; he was brutal, brazen, and honest to fault. He spoke what was on mind and found myself smiling and liking it. I felt bad for him at times because like Hunt I have a scar on my face from a car accident and I was embarrassed by it and sometime I'm still am, so I related to the character so much. I loved Lila character as well she tried her best not to fall for him while trying to keep her dignity. I like that the ""Write"" didn't make them fall in love so quick and like I said the honesty of Hunter and plain-spokenness is so needed in others writers' characters. I love the book and it was worth it. I read it in one night.My top 10 favorites1. Mistress to the Beast2. Her Russian Billionaire3. Fling in Paris4. Kidnapped by a Greek Billionaire5. Maid for a Billionaire6. Delaney's Desert Sheikh7. Weekend required8. Beauty and the Sheikh9. The Doctor's Secret Bride10. Blacking the Billionaire",5,1
"i've read ms erickson other books (entangled and forbidden) and actually liked them so i did not hesistate to buy this one... big mistake. i couldn't relate to the characters at all i think the story was too short to explore this complex storyline. even the sex scenes where boring... SPOILER ALERT.. so basically, female like this gay guy (he's never been with a girl) and decide to finally pursue him. he's involve in a serious relationship with another guy who's bisexual. everyone have sex. she and bisexual guy fall in love with each other and shut out the gay guy.. meanwhile gay guy falls in love with female (but oh well) but she doesnt love him like that and on top of that he also loses his live-in lover. what takes the cake is: at the at end the girl and bisexual guy want the gay guy to have one last sex scene even though gay guy was depress and upset with how things turn out.. and guess what? he did it (why? i don't know).",1,0
"The first half of the book, imo, lacks cohesion. The characters are not very developed. I never understood going from not knowing each other to joking like they had been doing it for years. The story line jumps around and it can be really confusing. And somewhat boring. As is the debating about morality and vampires.But about half way through, it all changes. I still don't see WHY the character's came together, but the story from now on makes sense.I am looking forward to the next books in this series.",4,1
"This is a nice little story. I enjoyed the characters but basic. I was thinking that this would be spectacular when I read the summaries and the other remarks. Not what I expected, just a normal story.",3,1
"Dear me!  The good points about this book is that it can be downloaded for only $2.00 and can be read in a little more than an hour.  I see that there are two 5-star ratings that have been written.  Is T. A. Chase a friend of theirs?  I found the writing puerile and totally lacking of any tension or drama.  While sometimes nice endings are wonderful and there was one character (great aunt) you loved, this book is not even worth the [...] for a download.  Sugary sweet is all it is -- and I generally love gay romance novels!",1,0
"As I stated on my Kindle, This book is an excellent read. Interesting to note that it takes place right after the First World War. The Author indicates there appears to be an open door towards another war. However, this other war is the war of ideology. It would be very much like the Cold War we experienced between the Free World and the Marxist World. Along with that, there is a fair amount of fiction as Bulldog Drummond and his many relationships are all fictional. In any event, the Author has the unique ability to blend the two together. As stated previously, this book is an excellent read. Thank you.",5,1
"Loved everyone of the Alpha males...the females however in book 1 and 2 leave me with a bad taste in my mouth, not so much book 1 as 2 but if you like whiny heroines you'll love these. Its nothing though you cannot get around and Michaela in book 3 more than makes up for tem.",4,1
"I know a lot of people were saying that the book was too short, but in my opinion, it was too long. If a writer is going to write a short story, at least give it an ending. But no, even if the next book picks up with the same characters, and we finally get to see what comes of them, it just is not enough to get me to throw down doe.You get what you pay for with this story, so don't expect to see much happen outside what the description says, because you'll build yourself up for a big let down.",2,0
"A teacher/student realationship story that falls short!! Talk about super slutty student!! I mean I realize they wanted each other,but come on now!! It was too quick for me! Craig was all almost likeable, but he seemed off why would he let his brother be with Jessica!! That was so weird!! Then they fall in love- what way off pace!!",2,0
"its not the worse, but it had a childish feel - maybe im too picky but nothing I would recommend",1,0
"I'll be honest. I didn't finish the book so it may be a little unfair to judge it... But I just got bored. I wasn't wild about the writing style.. Just too much superfluous information. Also some of the descriptions seemed too overdone or obvious.The strangest thing was the cover. Yes, yes...I shouldn't judge a book blah blah ... But the cover image was way hotter than the story itself. (does that make me a bit shallow?) Added to that, it states that the book is part of a BEST SELLING TRILOGY. Was this really a best seller? Really?Sorry but I didn't like the characters, didn't love the writing style and just couldn't get into the story.",2,0
Good read I loved it they are not the main characters but Miller and Meshell too funny good read for me,4,1
It's hard to say I love this book but it does deserve 5 stars.  It is emotionally very wrenching but very educational and a must read especially  for all those who say the Holocaust is a lie.  I can't imagine surviving the atrocities of the ghetto and the camp.  Only a strong person can survive to live a normal life.  A necessary read.,5,1
"This is a very hot short story. I got this thinking it was a Christmas story, but it's not, though there IS a snow storm.Sera (phina) is an empath who had fled her New Hampshire home after her NYPD-turned-small-town sheriff boyfriend Jake broke her heart. They had been making love, and for the first time, she gave him the full Monty, mind to mind. He didn't let the doorknob hit him on the ass as he raced away.Now Sera's back, having learned to better control her powers, Jake has done a little growing up and research. A freak snowstorm traps them together, and provides the excuse that of course Sera has to take off all of Jake's clothes, and her own, to warm him up and save his life. (How many times has this been done?) Still, they're both likable characters, Cody the dog adds a humorous touch, and the sex is hot. Enjoyable, and I'd like to read more by this author.",4,1
"Although one of the main characters was emotionally challenged, I did enjoy this book and the storyline...I found it to be a quick easy read.",3,1
Short and sweet and doesn't pretend to be any more than it is so overall this was an ok read.  Would I read more?  Probably not!  I like a little more depth with the sex but then again it was written well and easy to read.,3,1
"Dana Cochran was living a fantasy.  She was enjoying the pleasure of being with two men, and although she knew it couldn't last forever, she was going to play hard until it was time for their threesome to be over.  Both her men had to die for physiques.  Mason Caldwell set her body aflame, and she had been seeing him for a long time, but she has always known that he wasn't a keeper.  Emotions never came into play between them.  It was another story when it came to Jacob McCoy.  She had known him most of her life.  They were first and foremost friends that had become lovers one rainy storm filled night.  She had dated him in high school, college, and now they were intimate again.Jake has loved Dana his entire life.  Seeing her at the hospital where they both worked was difficult enough, but since she lived across the street from him, seeing her with Mason was killing him.  He never intended to become involved in a m&eacute;nage, but if it was the only way he could have her then he would take what he could get.  It took everything in him to keep his cool around Mason.  He just wanted to shout out his undying love from the rooftop.  Jake wanted a real relationship with Dana, and hoped that someday his wish would be granted.This is a very sensual but a highly emotional story.  Most of this story is told from Jake's point of view, and we get to see his inner struggle.  He has longed for Dana his entire life, and to be forced to share her is almost more than he can bare.",4,1
I really enjoyed reading this book. I loved the story line. A really hot book. Wish this kind of thing would happen to me.,5,1
A quick little story which tells us about the time Kaylee spends in the physch ward mentioned in the first book. I think if I'd read this first I might have been a little confused. But I was curious as to what happened her and how she felt in there. Plus knowing what you know after reading the first book you really think how could her Aunt & especially her Uncle have put her in that situation in the first place when they knew exactly what was happening. If I was her I would have been PPIIIISSSSSEEEDDDD when I found out!,3,1
"These are very nicely written with lots of great vocabulary which I love especially since I have the click link for full definition!  The mysteries are not written from the point of view of the doctor, so you get to wait until the testimony to see if your accused will be found guilty! Some follow the &#34;Watson&#34; style character, some follow the innocent person caught in a horrible web of guilt, and some even follow the perpetrator! They are quite wonderful. Slight warning for you to be aware that in those times often the 'gentlemen' and 'ladies' (whites) are considered less &#34;suspicious&#34; than the &#34;foreign&#34; characters. But if you only read books with modern mores you will miss much.",5,1
"~ 2 Zorn Stars ~Ral&#8217;s Woman is the first book in the sci-fi romance &#34;Zorn Warriors&#34; series. Well I&#8217;ve not read much sci-fi alien romance love stores, so I don&#8217;t have much to compare this too, though I have read other Laurann Dohner works and I must say Ral&#8217;s Woman was poorly done.Ral is a Zorn alien. Him and his people have been cavorted and in slaved by the lizard aliens to mine the astroid/ship. When he meets Ariel he is really curious about her and is eager to learn the ways of pleasing a woman of her species. He&#8217;s very partitive of Ariel: &#8220;She is mine. Don&#8217;t touch her. You touch her. You Die.&#8221;Ariel well first I thought of the little mermaid and had a good laugh, but moving on. Ariel is human and she has been kidnapped from Earth by lizard type aliens who want to breed her. As it turned out she is not compatible to breed with the lizard guys, so instead they give her to the Zorn who they have in slaved to mine their astroid/ship. The Zorn must fight and the winner gets her. Ral wins and takes her to his room caveman style where they have hot sex. Then he starts saying that she is his. &#8220;I think you don not understand. You are mine for life. I claim you. I won you. I will keep you. We will breed often and I am hoping you will take my seed to root.&#8221;It&#8217;s a very simple read, short, not very well done, and predictable. Not much world creation, but maybe in the other books it comes out. The description of sex scenes was poor, character development is nell, and I never felt a connection between Ariel and Ral. Maybe it was supposed to happen when they locked eyes at first meeting, but I felt nothing and as the book progressed I still did not feel that love connection even when they mentioned love.",2,0
"I didn't finish this book, got bored hence the default 1* rating. Poorly written, not enough detail, gaping plot holes, and tedious.I'm not sure what category to put this in - this story is- NOT erotica (As some reviewers have pointed out. Not enough sexual tension etc);- NOT SciFi; far too unimaginative and unsophisticated;- NOT well written enough or engrossing to be a good story- hence may be it's geared towards the tender romance variety? But I didn't feel any chemistry for that either.Overall, perhaps it's just a little bit of the above genres but not enough to be any of thoseI like books that capture my interests. There are some books that require one to read a good few chapters before one is engrossed. Due to the gaping plot holes, the poor writing style and lack of imagination this didn't intrigue me.=================The Characters:Heroine: Mari speaks many different languages and is a linguist, hence she picks up the Alien language very quickly. Her age wasn't really mentioned in the chapters I read, but the readers are informed on numerous occasions that she has vivid red hair (I assume she's a natural ginger sans freckles). She's defiant and originally challenges her captors. However, after the hero spares her, she's rather mellow and doesn't seem freaked out by being far away from earth and living in Alien territory.Hero: apart from being rather tall with cat like eyes, there's not much Alien about him that i could tell. Mari, the heroine describes him as resembling Native Americans, however, I've never seen bronze 7 feet Native Americans (the few I met were mixed heritage and resembled light-skinned Hispanic). He's rather mild, not the Alpha Male type. Basically, he's a tall, dark handsome cliche found in chick lit but with feline eyes. It's unfortunate the author didn't make him purple or blue skinned with horns on his head or something more imaginative. Tall, bronze skinned with long black hair reminds me of men I've seen from certain Middle Eastern countries and Punjab.================Plot holes:I'm not going to mention the glaringly obvious plot holes or I'll give away the story. However, a few are:1. The Alien species can speak English. Even the heroine points out that if one can converse with a species than it doesn't make much sense to allocate them as pets or food? The responding argument was not convincing enough to make this plot work. Even during the slavery trade - one of the reasons why slavers believed they were dealing with inferior species was because they believed the Africans they dealt with did not have a formal language or a proper culture.2. The Aliens believe that the humans are primitive and don't posses a proper culture. Considering that Earth has satellite it would be pretty easy for the Aliens to pick up a huge amount of data which would prove that humans have a form of electronic communication, entertainment and civilisation. The Aliens own form of living isn't very sophisticated hence I didn't understand why they thought they were so much more superior? I appreciate it might be a denial process (to justify the capturing of women) but again far too far fetched an argument. The Aliens technology such as their ""blackberry"" type hand held computer would be easily spotted by any number of aliens visiting earth.3. Considering the Aliens were suffering plagues and so forth - surely earth would have far more valuable possessions than human meat that would help them - additionally, you'd think they'd have sophisticated vaccinations or protective gear too.4. Mari manages to convince the Aliens within a space of a few minutes that she ought to be allowed to stay awake and engage in conversation with them. It seems that the aliens capitulated far too quickly. The story also jumps so one minute she's woken up and confronting them and the next minute we're told it's been a few days and they're impressed by her oddity.5. The Aliens do not look much different from many humans living on Earth. If they'd traveled to South East Asia, the Middle East or even the Far East they'd see beings much like them. Hence, their incredulity over Mari being able to engage in conversation with them is baffling. In fact even if they were to visit Norway or Iceland they'd find Viking like tall people (when I go there I feel like a munchkin and I'm 5.9). Hence, the story just wasn't convincing.I can't get into the reasons properly because I don't want to give away the story. I think it would be better if the Aliens found Mari in a primitive planet where her spaceship and stranded. The beings of that planet could be primitive but human physically and thus they mistaken her for one of them - when she's out bathing or something. She eventually slowly learns a few of their tongue and thus they are shocked by her even talking to them.================Summary of Plot:Mari (a human) was collecting eggs when she's captured by an Alien species with the intention to sell her at a meat market (humans are an expensive delicacy for certain species). The Aliens failed to tranquilize her properly and hence she wakes up to find herself naked and trapped in a cage on a cargo spaceship.She engages with her captors who are surprised by her ""intelligent"" form of interaction as they assume humans to be uncivilised and non-sentient beings. When they try to return her to hypersleep, she resists. Within the space of a few minutes and without much persuasion she manages to convince them to allow her to stay awake and in a page or two later she's managed to persuade the Hero that's she's not a pet or food.",1,0
"The story was slow and spent so much time on the inadequacies, insecurities, and low self-esteem of the lead character Amanda that it killed the book for me. Amanda was loud and irrational, like a bull in a china shop.  None of the characters were likeable.

If you want to study customes and history and gods of old Egypt this book is for you. I wished the book had more of it's story line. I think the story line would be great.

"There are a bazillion cookbooks out there.  If I had to choose just ONE, this is it.I owned a restaurant for 15 years, and Cooks is the one source of consistent inspiration that I have found.What separates Cooks from all the rest is their discussion of what does NOT work in the recipe.

"Book 1 of ""Serengeti Shifters"". Followed by Book 2Serengeti Storm.Note ""Serengeti Heat"" appears inShifting Dreamsalong withThe Man of Her Dreamsby Robie Madison andKiss and Kinby Kinsey W. Holley.Plot:From the author: ""On the secluded Three Rocks Ranch somewhere in West Texas, a secretive community of lion-shifters walk the line between between animalism and humanity. Torn between instinct and logic, and constrained by the traditions of their pride, four dominant lions must claim their mates - without drawing the attention of the human world outside their borders.""The book: Ava was the runt of the pride - always in the shadows, bullied by everyone. And she really, really needed to get laid. When new pride leader Landon finds her at a bar, he knows she's special. Can he convince her she's more to him than one orgasmic night?Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifters) erotic romance.- 1718 kindle locations, 27,000 words (but finishes around 1472 locations).- m/f - explicit, frequent, sometimes aggressive (not gentle), fun.- ""Author's Note: All of my books can be read independently, but characters from previous books make appearances in later books in each series."" It is best to read the books in order.- Includes excerpts fromKiss and Kinby Kinsey W. Holley andThe Man of Her Dreamsby Robie Madison.- Note there is a free pdf available on the author's website ""A Serengeti Christmas"". It fits as Book 1.5 (a prequel to ""Serengeti Storm"").Opinion:A fun, erotic paranormal where being a shape shifting lion is an important character attribute rather than an addendum so you can fit in the genre. Lots of fun, very lusty, and a good short read. A good start to a series, but can also be comfortably stand alone. Well worth it.4.5 stars rounded down. I particularly enjoy that Ava isn't a classic Alpha female, the fact they are *lions* is important and relevant to the plot, and the sex is *fun*.-CR-",4,1

"Great fun!  I enjoyed this epic adventure into the &#34;center&#34; of the earth.  I remember seeing the movie as a kid--my mother was even more enthusiastic about the movie than I was.  Well, of course, her name was Gertrude, the same name as Han's pet goose.  However, Gertrude did not appear in the book.  Vernes' adventures are very serious and engrossing--no Spielbergish humor, thank goodness. I am so glad I discovered these books late in life when I was willing to give them a chance.  Even more engrossing and fun is Vernes',  The Mysterious Island.  That one was my first of his adventures and what I consider to be his masterpiece--at least until I find one I like even more.",4,1

"Dylan Gennaro and Abby Adler are on the run from their violent alpha, Alan Matthews. Alan turned Abby against her will a month ago, and treats women very badly. Although Abby is more of an alpha wolf and Dylan is much more submissive, he knows he needs to get her out of this cruel pack. Near by is Red Rock Sanctuary, a pack led by Gavin and his mate Samantha. They take in runaways from these packs that have violent out of control alphas. They get word Dylan is on his way, but it starts to get late. Gavin sends one of his alpha wolves, Keith to investigate. Keith is an alpha in the pack and has spent years fighting in the wars against the wizards, so he is good in these situations. Keith discovers Abby and Dylan on the side of the road, fighting off a couple of Alan's wolves sent to bring them back. After Keith shoots them all (Did I mention he is lethal?) he escorts them safely to Red Rock.They are welcomed and given a safe place to stay. One of the first rules Gavin has is all new wolves need a Guide, someone to lead new wolves through the first couple of months. Not only teaching them the basics of being a shifter, but the bond usually goes much more intimate than that. At the end of the Guide period, the couple can choose to go their separate ways or sometimes feelings have developed and they stay together to explore their relationship.As soon as Abby and Keith meet, their wolves immediately take notice of each other. Their human sides are also very attracted. Abby has to be the one to choose the Guide, and not forced into the decision. Keith with an overwhelming protectiveness needs Abby to choose him, but being the gentleman he lets her have time to adjust and look over her options. Abby knows he is the one, and when the sexual tension is about ready to burst, she agrees and the first lesson he teaches her is in the bedroom. But the fun ends when Abby gets a picture of her sister, who has been kidnapped by Alan. With Keith's help, they race to save her.Cry Sanctuary is full of alpha male goodness. The moment Keith, or I should say his wolf sees Abby, that is it for him. He goes into growly, overprotective mode. He stalks around, on edge, being a perfect gentlemen towards Abby, but letting everyone know she is off limits. Years ago, he lost a lover, and the raw emotions from that relationship coupled with his alpha status, make for a very intense male. He sees being her Guide as an honor, and the thought of any other male near her makes him almost lose control.Abby also exudes alpha status, and although she is terrified and confused by her new life, she is a tough cookie. She accepts Keith from the beginning. I like that they never refuse or deny their attraction. When they come together, two powerful wolves in the bedroom, it's a smexy overload. Abby feels guilty for having these strong feelings for Keith and for wanting him sexually at the same time as having him for her Guide. It takes prodding from both Keith and some friends to convince her Keith wants the same thing.We also meet the other wolves of Red Rock. Leaders Gavin and Samantha run a tight ship but are very warm. Joe, Keith's friend stays his friend after he realizes Abby is off limits and provides some very sarcastic comments. Abby's friend Dylan, who is more submissive gets a book in this series and I can't wait to see what they do with his character. I sometimes thought all the residents of Red Rock, or at least the ones we meet are a little too perfect. Everyone is so nice and welcoming but you can argue Gavin is a strict alpha and doesn't let anyone get out of line. This book is also on the shorter side so we don't get a lot of background into the war with the wizards but there are several more books to the series and I'm looking forward to reading more about this group. Although there is a satisfying ending, there is much left to explore.Cry Sanctuary is a action filled paranormal romance, with plenty of alpha action to steam up the pages.",4,1

"I very much enjoyed this Jules Verne book.  It kept my interest most of the time.  I did think that some of the descriptions of the castaways' creations were lengthy.  I also thought that a lot of what he wrote, he had never actually experienced any of these things, so was a bit naive.  But this book definitely makes one think what they would do in such circumstances.",4,1
I had read all these years ago.  I recently found Wings in the Night Part 1 for a real deal and decided to download to my kindle and revisit one of my favorite series from long ago.  I got caught up again.  I then immediately upon finishing part 1 downloaded Wings in the Night Part 2 and read all of them.  I am now looking on the Wings in the Night Web Site and checking for Rhiannon's Chronicles and info on the new books coming out.  This series does not disappoint.  It matters not if you are revisiting it or if you are a first timer.  It will set the scene for the new books and/or give you a great series for your immediate enjoyment.  I highly recommend.,5,1
"I loved the wonderfulDiving in Deepby K. A. Mitchell so much that I decided to check out her other work.  HOT TICKET is a short, fun, and surprisingly emotional read by this great author.This is a cute book with great characters.  The beginning is a bit confusing because the author chooses to reveal background info very slowly, but the rest of the book flows smoothly as the pieces begin to fit together.  Elliot is a sweet geeky guy, and Cade is sensitive and smart despite his rebel appearance.  The men have more in common than they think, and they begin a steamy affair.The sex in this book is extremely hot but still tasteful.  The two men have fantastic chemistry, and they seem to understand each other on a deep emotional level.  Despite their very different exterior appearances, they are kindred spirits.The conflict in this book is mostly internal, and is mostly from Cade's end.  He has been burned by bad relationships in the past, so he has trust and commitment issues.  Elliot is much younger and very inexperienced, and Cade can't imagine Elliot wanting to stick around.K. A. Mitchell is very good at character-driven romance.  The tiny bit of external conflict is secondary to the relationship and the romance, and Ms. Mitchell puts a lot of focus on feelings and growth rather than on the external forces that interfere.This is a short book, just under 80 pages.  It will make a wonderful addition to your ""Rainy Day"" list.",4,1
"This book is well worth reading. The characters are real, the situations are believable, and the action rarely stops. The writing needs a little editing, but for the most part the book is very enjoyable.",4,1
"I love Jaid Black's books, but this one was too short and too rushed. It had a nice start to it and then it just ended. You didn't even get to care about the characters. The erotica was nice and well written, but this was overpriced for what it was.",3,1
"This is the first book I've read by Ally Blue and it won't be the last. I enjoyed this story immensely even if it was on the light side. There was little to no background or buildup, but somehow it worked as a short story about two very sweet people. I like the heroes this author created, they were good and kind people, even though there were some fights and arguments, they worked things out. I was not a fan of the whole developer and corrupt city officials part of the story but luckily for me, that was only a brief part of the whole story. I enjoyed this very much and would recommend it to others as a hot, romantic MM read.",4,1
"I absolutely loved this short story. The whole aspect of it in general was interesting. The sex in it was great, not too much but just enough in my opinion. I wish it was a longer book, I want more :)",5,1
"Pete Toleffson is in Konigsburg, Texas because his brother Cal has finally convinced his fiance Docia to have a wedding ceremony. He's Cal's best man, but he has no idea what a best man is supposed to do, exactly. He's pretty sure he's not supposed to punch his brother, but the impulse is there every time he catches sight of Calthorpe's ever-present and perpetually satisfied grin. It's not that Pete begrudges his brother's happiness, but Pete's in a strange town full of stranger people and ragged from his job as a county attorney - a job that he tends to obsess over...to the point that he can't remember the last time he took a vacation. Staying away from his email and voicemail while he's in Konigsburg takes conscious intensive effort, and he could buy stock in the antacid company that keeps his acid reflux in check. Supporting his brother through The Wedding from hell might just be his undoing.If sheer force of will and hard work can make The Wedding go as planned, Janie Dupree's life would be a lot less complicated. Unfortunately, everything about The Wedding seems destined to a calamitous end despite all her efforts and the best man is absolutely no help. Not to mention, he's rude. Cute though. But Janie's seeing someone...sort of...even if he is boring and self-involved. And then there's The Wedding, which is taking every single ounce of self control and mental fortitude to deal with.Just when Pete is starting to relax, and starting to more than notice Janie and even step up a little in his best man role, Toleffsons start to pour into Konigsburg and it becomes painfully clear that the town is definitely not big enough for all of them. Neither Pete nor Janie would put money on surviving The Wedding intact.Since stumbling acrossVenus in Blue Jeans: Konigsburg, Texas Book 1when it was offered as a free Kindle download on Amazon.com, I've become totally addicted to the town and inhabitants of Konigsburg, Texas, and thoroughly pleased with Meg Benjamin as an author. With a smooth, crisp writing style that highlights the strength of the series - the quirky characters that populate Konigsburg - and makes the narrative flow surprisingly well with whatever crazy situations those characters find themselves, Benjamin has a gem of a series on her hands. As I was withVenus in Blue Jeans, I was surprised and impressed with just how quick and fun a read Wedding Bell Blues is, and credit the author for both the fluidity of the narrative and the charm of the characters and setting.I liked Pete and Janie - perhaps not quite as much as Cal and Docia, but still they were a pleasure to read about. I don't think Pete's character was quite as well developed in the beginning of this book as Cal's had been in his, so the evolution of Pete's character from sourpuss jerk to nice guy was a bit subtle, but I enjoyed the results all the same. The Wedding is a good foil for the book, though the insular nature of wedding preparations did slightly diminish the role of the town and townspeople as the forces of nature they were in the first book. What it provided, however, was a surprisingly realistic and occasionally tragic conflict with the Toleffson and Dupree families' dynamic.There was little smooth about that dynamic. With one brother whose wife is a vapid trollop with the maternal instinct most cobras would envy, a mother who disapproves of everything and anything, and an eldest brother with far too much bad history to forgive, Pete's family was pretty much nightmarish. I didn't much care for the mother or the sister-in-law, but thought it was great storytelling. Janie's got some conflict with her mother over the guy she's seeing and she allows herself to be a bit of a doormat in a couple of places when being nice didn't serve her very well, but I actually know people just like her so there was definitely a sense of realism to her character.As much as I wish a couple of the less than pleasant people in the book got more of a comeuppance, I appreciated the story as a whole and was thrilled to see the direction it's taking. I had a bit of an issue in the previous book with the speed with which Cal and Docia got together, and for my personal preferences, the relationship between Pete and Janie developed in a far more pleasing time frame, right up until the end. There was a massive leap in development towards the end that seemed abrupt and precipitous, but overall I enjoyed the entirety of their relationship.I thinkVenus in Blue Jeanswas a bit more quirky in both character and story, and just a touch more charming because of it, but Wedding Bell Blues was a more complex tale that provided more depth with the familial issues and in my personal opinion, was more realistic with an overall better plot. I've become a huge fan of Benjamin and this series and am looking forward to continuing withBe My Baby: Konigsburg, Texas, Book 3. I've enjoyed the Toleffsons and love the town and people of Konigsburg. I can't wait to return. 4.5 Stars.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",5,1
"A girl and her 3 guy pals, just jump into it. Charli finds herself on a decidedly decadent shore excursion, playing ""The Race Erotic"". With each sexy challenge, it becomes clearer that down deep, she desires not one, not two, but all three of her remaining single buddies. She definitely wins the race.I wish this was stretched out more.  Scenes of erotic sex seemed a bit fast, and rushed.  Slowed down and expanded this would be a more wonderful romantic story.  It pushes my boundaries when she writes about the Man-on-man scenes but they are romantic, sexy, and in a menage situation, and very well done.",4,1
"I found Vol 1 to be well written blending both the old and the new.  It was true to a singular focus and the characters were unique.  I enjoyed the banter between Maggie and Link and it reminded me of the ""Moonlighting"" TV series of years past with Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd.  I admit I wanted to strangle Maggie many times but that was part of her charm (I guess).I don't have any idea of the authenticity of La Malinche or Montezuma's Treasure itself and that is not important.  The author made it all believable to me in a fictional way.  I give Vol 1 5 stars and commend the author for a job well done.",5,1
I thought that this was a bit predictable. But it wasn't that bad. I would only read it if it was free thou.,3,1

"This book confuses me a bit, is a somewhat original take and I love the lead character is a young girl, but is not extremely well put together, since this is aimed to be a set of books one can argue the plot ""holes"" are due to that, that remains to be seem on volume II, whenever is out. I recommend the book for vampire stories fans, but for more mainstream readers I'm not sure if the appeal will hold.",3,1
"I have really enjoyed this series. This is the second book in the Rachel Myers series. I am familiar with the setting even though Ms. Jackson slightly changes the names of the towns. I like the way the author tells a story. Each book flows into the next one- so be sure to read them in order. In this book, Rachel's lifelong friend Isaac has her investigate the death of his friend. Isaac knew his friend was afraid of heights and that he would never get that close to the edge of the overlook. So Rachel starts investigating with her logical mind she is soon able to find out what really happened. If you like mountains, cozy mysteries, horses and plants, you will not be disappointed with this series.",5,1
"Cassie Jordan may be newly engaged but that doesn't stop her from thinking about the two men she left behind.  That's why she's heading back to her hometown in rural Idaho to confront her memories and feelings once and for all.Nice guy Kyle Watson and dark and brooding Alan Caine have known Cassie since she was just a little girl.  They'd been inseparable and as they grew up their feelings inevitably changed to a deep-seated desire which none of them addressed.Eventually Kyle and Alan's feelings result in a sexual frustration that needs to be assuaged so they turn to each other.  Unfortunately Cassie witnesses their encounter and jumps to the conclusion that they've chosen each other over her.  It's been three years since she last saw either of the men and she learns they now live and run a ranch together.  Kyle and Alan aren't stupid, they realize that Cassie would never choose one of them over the other so they'd agreed to share her - that had been before she'd run away.  Now that she's back it's up to them to convince Cassie that they love her and a relationship between the three of them could work.Sierra Dafoe has definitely won over many readers with her warmhearted, tender storylines.  Cassie, Kyle and Alan's unique relationship fascinated me because the men waited so long for Cassie to return to them.  Their love for her is obvious in everything they do.  One of my favorite things about this story is the differences between the men and how that plays into how she responds to each of them.  THE BOYS BACK HOME is a quick read that certainly doesn't lack for emotional impact or sexual tension.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",5,1
I really enjoyed this book because it ended on a happy note even though the one character died. I will probably read more by this author.,4,1
"I know it cost nothing, and that is just what it is worth. I couldn't get past the first few chapters. The swearing was put in just for shock value, and over the top, the narrative was odious and none of the characters were at the least likable, or even a decent anti hero. The writing is amateurish and cluncky. If it was a paper back it would have ended up in my compost bin....just don't bother.",1,0
I liked a lot abt the two heros: Zack & Ace. Both arresting and sexy. The heroine was likable but her character had less substance. Overall nicely written but mostly romance novel without decent plot development. Quick read & heats your blood ;-),3,1
"3.5 StarsThis is one hot and steamy paranormal romance! It has vampires and erotic romance rolled into one-my favorite! It's the first book to the Midnight Playground series and a good start at that. I think this book may be a long novella since I was able to read it in a few short hours. I had no idea it had menages in it. Maybe I should have looked at the cover first. Nice little surprise there. :)Hex and Aleron have been together for ages, until Nissa walks in and captures the attention of both men. They all spend time together enjoying each others company...and boy oh boy was it hot! Eden sure knows how to write a sex scene! But in the end, only one man is left standing with Nissa. I did feel sorry for the one male left on his own. It wasn't a sad ending where they parted on bad terms...they clearly want each other to be happy...but I just want him to get his happy ending and hopefully he will. The Seeking Kiss was a quick and fast read that will keep your blood pumping until the very end.This is my first read by this author. I like her writing style a lot and ordered some books online, waiting impatiently for them to come in the mail.",4,1
"The stories were not bad but the story would have been a great read if the author would have focused on one story only.  A short story is presented,leaving the ending up to the reader.  We are then introduced to a couple of stories in an attempt to get us to buy them. I wouldn't buy them.",3,1

"This book is not as exciting as the other book M.H. Sargent has written.  Pretty Blah. Yes it has a plot, but the situations each of the main characters are in don't come close to seeming real.  The foul language used is uncalled for in many of the situations, & the &#34;F&#34; word is used too much.  I said I'd read the next book & if it had the language this one had in it I wouldn't read the others that I purchased...but gladly the next book is much better.

"Part of me cringes at this very idea. I told it to shut up. Lennox delivers here what I've come to depend on her for, fast fiction, well written, exquititely romantic.",4,1
This is a cute little quick and I mean quick story. The plot or concept are 2 people writing each other and falling in love.  i must admit in the beginning the author includes the letters that they are writing each other.  For me it got a little annoying but it doesn't matter. Sean was crazy sexy and I loved Eve's personality. If you are the type that wants to feel connected to the characters on some deep level then this might not be for you as it's fast paste. The sex is a thumps up it was quick but still a thumps up.,4,1
"Between political struggles and his being a vegetarian, I was looking for a bit more on the spiritual side. After all, he was called Mahatma. Which means great soul. (This review has to be short.)Gandhi was confronted by Christians who wanted to sell him their twisted idea of Christianity. Actually he was greatly moved by Tolstoy's work; Tolstoy hated how Christians distort the teachings of Jesus, and are so anxious to wage war. Jesus taught 'love thy neighbor' and &#34;turn the other cheek&#34;.He struggled with diet, he refused to eat meat, eggs, and refused even milk. In the end he tried to subsist on fruit juices. Gandhi believed that abstinence was important in realizing God, yet he was disgusted by his own lust and how he treated his wife.",4,1
"This is the first novella I read of Bob Moats, and I must say, it will be the last.  Here are my two reasons why.Reason #1:  The story was intriguing in the beginning, but the ending really pissed me off.  The ending was like a bad roller coaster ride.  It was just horrible!Reason #2:  I found the story very unbelievable that the chief would say there are not enough people, especially during a serial killing spree.  That is why states have a SBI (State Bureau of Investigation) unit, correct?  If not them, the FBI should have stepped in.Will I recommend this to anyone?  My answer would be a quick no.",2,0

"It should have been a day like any other but Anne hadn't even finished her morning non-fat latte before life as she knew it was changed forever.Right after exiting the coffee shot near her office Anne is approached by a man.  Only she quickly realizes that he isn't a man at all and wisely runs in the other direction.  The thing pursues her and Anne's fearful that she won't be able to outrun it.  Just when it seems hopeless, Anne is grabbed and she lets out a blood curdling scream.  Seconds later she's lulled to sleep by the man who holds her but first she sees a second man step out to deal with the monster who'd been pursuing her.Caleb and Van have been watching Anne for weeks.  According to the oracle the little bit of Valencia DNA she possesses makes her a perfect match for them.  Convincing her to leave her world and life to mate with them and relocate is a daunting task.  However, it's absolutely necessary because the Guardians have made it their personal goal to destroy all human females with Harmon blood and if the men don't take her with them now then she will die at the hands of one of the monsters.Being ripped from her home, career and life doesn't endear Caleb and Van to Anne.  Sure Valencia is beautiful and similar to Earth but it's not `home.'  There's no denying that Caleb and Van are gorgeous but no way can this all be a reality.  During the time she's in Valencia Caleb and Van become extremely important to Anne but can it really be love?  What about the Guardians threat to kill any woman able to mate with Harmon males?Anya Bast's TAKEN delivers on all those `out of this world' fantasies woman possess.  Anne's spunky attitude and refusal to blindly accept everything Caleb and Van tell her kept me chuckling - and kept her men guessing at what it would take to convince her to stay.  I was expecting a fun read when I selected this story but in no way did I anticipate the emotional impact it'd have.

"I normally love Robyn Carr.  Her Virgin River series is a favorite of mine.  I chose this one as the first to read on my new Christmas Kindle.  It wasn't very good.  Not up to Ms Carr's usual standards.  I understand that it was written in support of single mother's, certainly an important topic, but the preachy style didn't win me over.  It ended so abruptly I thought maybe I only had a sample.  I can't recommend this one, I'm afraid.  Her next Virgin River book comes out today and I'll certainly buy that one though.",2,0

Love this!  This book has several stories I had heard as a child and a few I had never heard or read.  Wonderful book!,5,1
"I enjoyed this book, and unlike another reviewer, I didn't really find the characterizations thin.  I liked Henry, and I thought his living arrangements had a lot of potential in subsequent books (and boy, would I like his house!).  I also liked the amount of detail that was given. Another reviewer referred to it as 'padding'.  Maybe it is, but I also liked the way it gave the story immediacy - you felt like you were right there, watching the goings-on.  The concept of a retired police chief helping out with current cases is no more or less implausible than most of the premises for most mysteries.  All things considered, most police departments nowadays would jump on the chance to have an expert, unpaid, consultant available!  I thought that the plot was interesting, the victim just 'shady' enough to be realistic.  My big gripe, if it can be called that, was with the ending when the murderer was revealed.  I don't necessarily dislike the author's decision on who should be First Murderer, but I didn't like the way he presented it - it was too sudden, too abrupt, and the clues leading to their identity were a bit too subtle and got lost in the shuffle, so to speak. If the author had eased Henry into his realization of who the murderer was more gradually and provided one more clue that pointed to that person, I think the ending would've been immeasureably improved.  All in all, this was a pleasant, easy read with a bit of a twist at the end.  I'd recommend it.Note on Kindle formatting:  Good.  There were a couple of issues, but nothing to distract from the reading experience.",4,1

"Grace is not your typical mother to a nine year old son. She burns cookies, sucks at housework, and generally has to make a huge effort to be domestic. What is she good at? Being a super agent of course. Nine years before, pregnant, shot by her lover Alex, the child's father; she makes a career change. Alex in the meantime has put together the Devlin agency and maintains two personages--that of Sean Devlin whom Grace thinks of as a best friend and confident as well as Alex Rossi, super agent! Grace has no idea that they are the same person. For some reason she never asks Sean why Alex shot her. She just assumes he put the job before her life and in order to achieve his objective to bring the bad guy down that is holding her hostage--he shoots her in order to get him.The story has so many unbelievable scenarios that in order to enjoy it for what it is--romantic suspense--you kind of have to suspend your belief in logic.This is a fast easy read. Don't expect it to make sense in terms of logic, plot etc. Stacey is weak on plot, but her dialogue and characters are fairly strong.",3,1

"None of the characters seemed believable to me or frankly, even very likable. Also, having two thirty-something people constantly reiterate how terrified they were of the mother was just ridiculous. I also couldn't understand how the main goal in the mother's life was to get her daughters married; it just didn't ring true. Also, the bride's hysterical behavior, which everyone indulges, added to the unbelievability of the story. I don't want to point out what I found wrong about the villain because that would spoil the plot. Another big detractor to the story was the very poor editing which really hindered the flow of the story. I did manage to finish the story but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.",2,0
"I'm going in the middle of the road on this one. Aggie, the main character seemed to always be short tempered, always accusing somebody of something. It wasn't a fun read, I didn't think it was comical, didn't care about the characters, sad that someone that tried to murder his mistress wasn't thrown in jail. Sabrina was a pathetic, unbelievable character, enough said.",3,1

"I love this series. The Westmoreland' s are a beautiful family. Each Westmoreland story is romantic, selfless, family oriented, and so full of love. I love Brenda Jackson's love stories, ( if you can call them that, because to me they are equally about family bonds)but, she does get a little repetitive with wording her love making scenes. I would still give her 5 stars on the story writing because I do love her take on romance, however, the editing of this five book set was awful. Need to use a better editor.",4,1
Great cover and I had high hopes. The story started out good but then the cussing started and didn't stop.,1,0
"I gave it a good try - the premise was really good but I could not make it through this one. The plot moved very slowly and really needs an editor to cut out some very poor dialogue and extra information that is not relevant.The dialogue sounds very stilted and written at most at a high school grade level and that would be a stretch.The main character Chloe is from California yet many British words for things which she would not use.Main story is sidelined by the relationship angles. She loves 2 guys - Tristan who has a unique story and Oliver - less interesting. Both of these guys are Ok with her not being able to make a choice. Much time spent developing this but again every time Chloe texted one of them it's in the book, if they don't text back, it's in the book, lots extras that detract from the story moving forward.Got to 60% done on my kindle then gave up/",1,0

"I bought both this book and Golden Eyes (they are related) in order to try out a new author.  I enjoy the shape shifter genre, so wanted to see if I would like her work.  Both books had potential, I thought, but I really wasn't interested in the sex - too much, too fast and certainly not traditional.  No real buildup in a relationship first - just jump into bed.  I was looking at some of her other books (she has a lot of them), but they warn of the same kind of sex, so I am probably not going there.",3,1
"The story premise was cute. Hunky editor ""tricks"" his prized writer into learning more about his desires. She thinks he's too hot to be interested. He's decided to go for broke to show her what she means to him. And, he's trying to bring her out of her funk after her cat died and show her that she CAN let someone get close enough for her to love. A handy snowstorm comes along to trap them together. It was very erotic, as the title suggests. Good, hot, short read. I will have to find more from Mari Carr.",4,1
"Having enjoyed my way through all of his major works, I am now filling in the remaining gaps in my reading of FP Wilson.  This one, ""Virgin"", was originally published in 1996 under the pseudonym, Mary Elizabeth Murphy. I have no clue why he used a nom de plume, except possibly that it is rather different from everything else that he had written to date.  Not horror, not SF, but your basic religious fantasy.  The eponymous Virgin is, indeed, Mary, the mother of Jesus, the one straight out of the standard Christian theology.This is nothing like Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code or any of his other novels.  Although the characters move around a lot, it's not anything like a treasure hunt, or, at least after the early sections of the novel, a mystery to be solved.  It's worth pointing out that it was published long before Brown sold millions of copies books dealing with supposed hidden truths of the Catholic Church. Anyway, the premise is interesting (as it is with all FP Wilson writings that I have seen), and to my knowledge is one of the first mainstream ""what if it were true"" novels dealing with the iconography of ChristianityAlthough published well after many of his blockbuster novels that made FPW a household name (at least among horror aficionados, Virgin has the feel of an ""early"" novel.  I'm not sure how to describe it more specifically than that.  It just didn't feel as solid as most of FPW's other works.  The characters of Father Dan and Sister Carrie are well enough developed FPW's usually are), and their early relationship is is believable.  Later developments between the two, well, less so.  Supporting characters were also three-dimensional with interesting backstories, particularly the mysterious Israeli agent who seems to have a special agenda with respect to the relic.For me the biggest disappointment in this novel was the ending.  After a more than reasonable build-up, the last 20% of the novel, especially the literal deus ex machina ending just left me feeling cheated.  As if FPW had jumped the proverbial (pun intended) shark.  I just didn't find the sequence of events believable or compelling or even logical (if anything based in religious mythology can be said to be logical).  The ending felt rushed, and cheap compared to the set-up, and to the endings to the dozens of other FP Wilson novels that I've read.Perhaps it's in part because I'm not a ""true believer"", and have always had trouble understanding how so many so easily accept the whole Christian mythos when it seems so full of logical flaws and impossibilities.  Anyway, this one didn't do it for me.  It was OK, but not nearly in the same league as the Repairman Jack or Adversary Cycle series, or many of his other parts of the Secret History of the World (e.g., Black Wind, published in 1988, being a prime example of FP Wilson at his best.)J.M.

Thank goodness this was free knew it was going to be short I always check the lenght before I down load.I did not see much to the story told in one person.Then there was was an abrupt ending and we had to decide what was going to happen. I really didn't care how it ended had no report withe the characters.This was my first time reading this author did not make me want to read her again.,1,0

I enjoyed this blend of police and paranormal. I found the concept of a physic police force with different talents quite unique. The characters were quirky and fun and the murder case interesting. Victor and Jacob were very appealing and not your typical cop characters.I have seen many excellent reviews for this series and many five star ratings given. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series and seeing if it grows on me more.,4,1
"The title of this book is so appropriate.  Love is not only found in one but multiple ways.  A young man alone, struggling and nearly destitute is found by his long lost love.  In turn, his love helps him reunite with his twin sister for whom he only wished to watch from the shadows on her blessed wedding day.There is passionate energy and desire battling against entrenched bigotry and rigidity. I was completely swept away.The lovers must embrace each other and their sympathetic friends and family to triumph.  This story truly set my heart ablaze at the courage and strength of the two lovers.  It was a triumphant tale to be savored and thoroughly enjoyed.",5,1
"The retirement plan of the Kurev mob family is death; either naturally or by hitmen.  No one just leaves alive.  Cynthia Beller and Lee Maxwell understand that first hand as her father Claymore and Lee, accountants at the same firm working the blood money of the Kurev mob, tried to quit at different times.  Nine years ago Claymore and his family except for his daughter Cynthia were murdered; three years ago, Lee survived the hit, but his wife and daughter were killed.  Each of the survivors vowed separately vengeance.They meet for the first time as Cynthia having just finished a kill is about to leave when Lee enters the abode to assassinate the same thug.  They encounter one another twice more before agreeing they have the same list and strategic BHAG.  They agree to team up to destroy the Kurev family by dividing up the kills.  Meanwhile though sympathetic to their cause and respecting them as he loves his wife and daughter that he might seek vengeance too if they were harmed, FBI agent Owen Dunham struggles with capturing the Grudge Ninja vigilante serial killer preying on the mob.This is an exhilarating serial killer thriller that hooks the audience because the key three players seem vulnerably human with remorse, regret, and resoluteness.  The vivid story line is action-packed especially with the scenes of the kills.  However, A.J. Scudiere's tense thriller belongs to the Grudge Killer(s) and the cop reluctantly trying to bring them to the legal justice system even as he believes their vigilante justice is just.Harriet Klausner",5,1
"This was a short but very hot read! I'm not going to write a plot summary here because, frankly, the story is so short that I'd be spoiling it by doing that. Suffice it to say that short stories don't always work for me, and this one did. Luke and Ava were very likable characters, and their falling in love was believable considering they'd known - and secretly lusted after - each other for 10 years. Oh, and the love scenes were sizzling hot! ;)Note: There was some light bondage but it was well done, so it didn't bother me. There was also mention of anal sex but it happens off the pages, so anyone who has a problem with that can easily skip those few lines.",4,1
I received this book from the author for a honest review. What a great story. The relationship between Marc and Blake is a complicated but interesting and romantic and the addition of their feelings for Kate very intriguing. The world that she has developed is a great background for a great trilogy. I will definitely be reading the rest of this Trilogy.,5,1

"I normally like this author, but this book wasn't very good. The female was just a weak chic that I couldn't like at all, and the guy was just kind of there...didn't like him, didn't dislike him. Just really didn't care. The story was bland and uneventful. The only thing that happened was when her boss finally crosses the line and starts groping her. Jake saves the day but then Mia isn't sure of she's going to quit because she really needs the job (excuse me...so you'll just go ahead and have sex with your boss then? Because that's what it seems like). Jake finally convinces her to quit by promising to take care of her (see what I mean my weak). So she quits but doesn't nothing about the sexually harassing boss. Yep, lets just leave him to harass the next poor girl who gets stuck working for the guy. I just can't stand weak female leads.My issue with the writing was that every other paragraph (literally) had &#34;as if&#34; in it. &#34;As if she couldn't resist&#34;, &#34;as if he didn't want to let her go&#34;. It was really annoying after awhile.Book 1 in this series was much better. This one almost read like the authors first work or something, it was really that bad.

"Half the time I wanted to slap this frikkin' chick...yeah, I understand getting hot under the collar at your husbands for forgetting your Anniversary (what red blooded female WOULDN'T?) and I had to say ""BRAVA"" for taking off to Jamaica alone.  I'd have done the same thing, hands down..no second thoughts needed. But her pity party after they reunite was enough to make me toss the book across the room...I mean, yeah!  I get being mad and hurt...I get that..and she had a right to be mad and put out...but these guys waiting on her hand and foot (and even though I could easily get used to that service....mmmmm yeah)...just griped me to see these two men grovel.This story is all about the compromises that are demanded in all marriages.  In this case, Catherine was the one who bent over backwards giving...and shame on her for never letting these two husbands know how she was feeling or that she was reaching a breaking/boiling point.  Guys are guys for cripes sake...add a workaholic into the mix and he's never gonna know that he's neglecting anyone unless it's brought to his attention...a lot!  And shame on THEM for pushing and taking advantage of such a kind soul.But in the end, all three characters, themselves, bring out these very points of contention.Even though I [somewhat] enjoyed this story and I thought it was told well with a good moral in the end, it's still a forgettable story.  It's not that it was a bad story...it's just not good.",3,1
"I downloaded this for my Kindle not knowing what to expect.  It just sounded like an interesting book.  I really ended up enjoying this book a lot.  It is a very classic fantasy tale with a lot of humor woven throughout.Wistril and his apprentice, Kern, live in Castle Kauph and in general just want to be left alone to their studies.  In these three stories about Wistril, that is just not meant to be. The three stories included are Wistril Besieged,Wistril Afloat, and Wistril Betrothed.  In each story Wistril shows that brain always triumphs over brawn and comes up with humorous solutions to rather difficult situations.I thoroughly enjoyed these stories.  Wistril is a pretentious, yet caring and hilarious wizard.  He constantly surprises the reader with his crazy solutions to problems.  Kern is a very competent apprentice who weaves tons of hilarious sarcasm throughout the novel.  Wistril is sworn, as a white wizard, to never harm with his magic and this adds an interesting twist to things.Tuttle has a very readable writing style that I really enjoyed.  He develops wonderfully quirky characters.  These stories really have a classic kind of tongue-in-cheek dungeon crawling humor to them.  I was pleasantly surprised and very amused.Overall I absolutely loved this book.  I immediately went online and got a couple more of Tuttle's Kindle books.  If you love classic fantasy with a humorous twist you have to check out this book.",5,1

"I have read other books by this author and I had great expectations for this book that were not met.  I was very disappointed. I was expecting a deep romance with a perceptive, empathic hero and a heroine who had been royally screwed by her fiance and sister.  This book was just rushed and weird.  It was like the author was in a hurry and left out details and wanted to throw way too much into this short book.First, there were alot of things just thrown in and blown over.  I cannot recall if I read what the heroine does for a living.  Also, there was alot of drama surrounding the sister running off with the fiance on the wedding day but there were no details given about the sisters' relationship before the incident.  There is the mention of a few other visitors and employees at the dude ranch but they are all glossed over. There is another man interested in thd heroine briefly.  He is given about 2 pages.  There is very little character development and I did not care about any of these people.  Even the sex scenes were skimpy and rushed.When the heroine goes to the ranch, there is a little drama with another woman who is chasing the hero but even this was confusing.  It was really not necessary to the story and the drama was not fully developed.  Just thrown in here and there almost like an after thought.Also, the heroine spends the first part of the book disliking the hero just because he was handsome and she was attracted to him, I think.  Not really sure why.  He spends all his time telling her he knows she does not like him.  That is the extent of his perceptive empath abilities.The secret is frankly, stupid.  I won't give it away but I guessed it pretty early.  I was hoping I was wrong because it really did not fit in with the story.  When it finally came out, even the reveal was less than satisfactory.  I cannot say more without spoiling this.The interracial aspect of this novel was non-existent.  There was a BRIEF mention of race and that was all.  These people could have been blue for all race mattered.The ending was a complete rushed cop out.  It really felt like the author realized ""oh yeah, I need to write a last chapter"" so she did so without any real buildup.  If you cared about the characters (which I did not), you would feel cheated by how fast their ""conflict"" was resolved and how.Two stars because this author has done better and she did make the effort to write this book.  The story has a good premise and a good start.  It just fell flat.",2,0
"When Lucia arrives on the doorstep of the King of Draconia, she had no idea her destiny would change so dramatically.  Or perhaps she was simply fulfilling her destiny?  No matter, she was just determined to save her dying friend, the dragon Reynor, and to do that she must engage the help of his Knight, Sir Kaden, or his love, the dragoness Linea.A waitress in a simple pub, Lucia certainly never expected to return to the tavern with two dragons, two Knights, and the Queen of Draconia herself in tow!  But it is just this troupe of heroes that arrive in time to help Reynor, for it is not just his body that is withering, but his spirit as well.It soon becomes clear to Knights Kaden and Marcus that Lucia is their mate, fated to complete the union between dragons and knights and round out their family.  But Lucia isn't from Draconia, and while she has heard rumor of the strange custom in which two Dragon Knights must marry one woman, she is uncertain she can go through with it...If you have read many of my reviews, it is no secret to you that I am a huge fan of author Bianca D'Arc, and most especially her Dragon Knights stories.  You can imagine my pleasure that she continues to imagine new stories for this fascinating series, and that she seems to have no trouble finding ways to keep the stories fresh and exciting, as proven once more with the newest edition in the saga, Wings of Change.With this new story, we enjoy a return to the m&eacute;nage theme that began the series.  This scenario guarantees some built-in angst for the story as Lucia tries to come to terms with the idea of mating with two men, a situation beyond her experience or the societal norms of her own country.  But Kaden and Marcus are more than up to the task of convincing her that their love is true and right, with a little help from Marcus' dragoness, the Lady Linea.Of course, the relationship between these three isn't the sole focus of D'arc's book - she fleshes it out nicely with some long-hidden secrets about Lucia, some of which she herself is hiding, and a few of which have been long hidden from her.  As we learn Lucia's secrets, we see that she may very well be a most important figure in the future of the war between Draconia and Sskithdron.The author introduces us to yet another most intriguing new species, something I believe I'm becoming rather spoiled on!  As a long-time lover of Fantasy stories, my excitement with the introduction of each new creature builds more and more, expanding not only the horizons within this world, but my interest as well.Wings of Change is the fifth story in the Dragon Knights series, and will be released in print in the future anthology, I Dream of Dragons I.  While this book can be read as a standalone without leaving the reader confused, the story will be best enjoyed if you read the entire series in order.

"Okay, so I read this story despite knowing that it was written by the author of ""Freeze"", a book I wasn't too fond of, and I am sorry to say I didn't like this one too much either. Here's why: First and foremost, like ""Freeze"", I found this story to be a bit juvenile, seemingly written for the preteen/teen crowd. Secondly, I dislike the author's fascination with the juvenile use of sex in this story; I mean really...two jerk (blank) sessions in one very short story accompanied by ongoing graphic references concerning semen and its various characteristics are a little much, don't you think??? There is the obligatory gore which seems to pervade this genre and, while some authors handle it well, this author overwrites his descriptive prose horribly. In addition, errors and omissions don't help garner higher ratings. Oh well, live and learn...perhaps the best tact for me is to simply stop giving this author other chances for redemption. I'll have to consider that. In the meantime...""SCRUBBING BUBBLES TO THE RESCUE""!",2,0

"First, let me say I ordered the next two books in the series.  They were worth the ebook price, but wouldn't be worth a regular paperback price.The setup was a little contrived, I expect some type of divine intervention explanation to cover why the earthquakes struck the military bases just when everyone went underground.The dialogue really is stilted, the author ought to record his daily conversations and compare them to dialogue in the book.  The characters talk like they were briefing a very picky 4 star general, not talking to friends.Some of the plot lines rely too much on coincidence.There are a lot of other negatives, but so what.This isn't great literature, but it's fun.

Although the details varied, there was a dreary ""They were dead all along!"" sameness to them (not as if that is the literal end to each story, but really -- close enough).

With a history of spells of black despair, Edwin can't be sure if his attraction to the strange magician is real or not...Sleight of Hand is an odd and hot paranormal tale in which things are not as they seem.  Katrina Strauss did an excellent job of evoking an atmosphere that was mysterious, and even a little spooky.  I couldn't always determine what was reality and what wasn't right away, which kept me reading to find out.  It was easy to sympathize with fragile, earnest Edwin.  Satori was a bit harder to get a handle on.  His motives were murky and although he clearly wanted Edwin, I wasn't sure I bought that he loved him.  There's a big twist at the end that sort of explains Satori's behavior, and quite a few other things.  Overall, Sleight of Hand's hot, kind of creepy vibe held my interest, and I enjoyed the story.  While the romance part might not have been the most convincing I've read, Sleight of Hand was certainly a memorable and page-turning tale.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",4,1

"I was familiar with the Lovecraft from the Call of Cthulhu RPG, but had never actually read any of the stories.Purchase of my Kindle led me to pick this up.  What a great deal for $2!The writing is amazing.  The ideas that Lovecraft either came up with or built upon are wonderful.  His Mythos is complicated and engaging.Lovecraft does a good job of referencing some earlier stories.  It's nice to hear about the Innsmouth Curse, for example, in multiple stories.  Though, you might get sick of hearing of the Mad Arab who wrote the Necronomican.  Seriously, was Mad part of his name?This collection, in my opinion, is front-loaded with the best stuff.  My favorites being The Call of Cthulhu, The Dunwich Horror and The Shadow over Innsmouth.  Though, the Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath is really good also.Now, be warned, this was written in a time when different language was acceptable.  Some of what he says is quite offensive, but, I hope readers can get past that to the true quality that is there.Easy 5 stars.Edit - I see that a rival publisher doesn't like this review, as all of the reviews here were down-voted after I pointed out this was the better version.

"Lets begin by saying I am a fan of this supernatural genre but this book was very disappointing. It suffers from an extreme identity crisis. Is it a supernatural story, a thriller, a comedy, a romance, a family melodrama, a cheesy graphic erotic novel or all six? At times it seemed like it had 4 writers. A better writer may have combines all that but that was not the case, the plot was messy and the end has so many silly twists and turns it gave the reader whiplash. The characters were stereotypes and barely two dimensional. The Benji character was particularly annoying with all his gay sterotypical comments. Even the most flaming gay man talks normally sometimes. I give this 2 stars based on the idea but without better execution ( and writing ) I am positive this series will be a big dud.",2,0
"I hate to be the almost lone dissenter here, but 72 hours is a story told at break neck speed losing what could have been a very good story and turning it into just ok.  I kept wanting to say, ""Whoa, slow down.  Let's learn about the characters before they go running off to be super heroes.""The Devlin Group is a group who stops Big Bad things from happening - like spreading poison all over Gitmo.Alex Rossi is the Super Hero leader who, at one time, worked with Grace, the Super Heroine. They were a great team with both of them equally able to get to the bad guys.  Alex also doubles as Sean Devlin, the founder of the Group.  He named the group Devlin to flush out the man who killed his Mother 11 years ago.  Grace was not aware of this story.  Alex and Grace had a baby but Alex was never told about him because Grace wanted to keep the baby, Danny, safe from the Super Hero's enemies.  All of this is for naught as Danny is kidnapped.  While this sounds somewhat complicated, Stacey does a good job of keeping things clear and the reader is never confused as to the story line.There are two other major characters, Carmen and Gallagher, who also help with the Devlin Group.The downside is that this adventure/romance is told so fast that there is little character development.  I know about as much about Carmen and Gallagher as you do right now. There was a whole story there left on the cutting room floor, so to speak, and the book would have been much better if Stacey had taken the time to allow the reader an insight into these two characters.Alex and Grace are somewhat better developed but still leave a bit to be desired.  Grace comes off somewhat naive in the ways of motherhood, to put it nicely.  For some reason we never know, she thinks being able to make cookies is more important in the raising of a child than allowing said child to get to know his father.  Go figure.  I still want to know what makes Grace tick.Stacey has talent but needs to learn a little about character development.  If the reader knows the characters, they care what happens to them.  While this is an exciting story, I never really cared if the characters lived or died except for what would happen to the child.",3,1
I really like Jennifer Crusie's writing and have enjoyed several of her books.  Her sense of humor is wonderful and refreshing.,5,1
"I enjoyed the premise of the book, but it seemed very disjointed at several points in the book . . .so much so that I e enjoyable went back to be sure that I hadn't skipped a few pages. When I got to the end, it seemed like it was the middle of the book still.  Very disappointing.",2,0

"What a quick and sexy read this was! It only took me about two hours to read this little number, but I wished it took me longer.Jessie and her bisexual friend Paul have been friends for over 10 years. Jessie has had feelings for Paul since they met but has never acted on them. She felt their friendship was too important so she didn't want to chance it. After being convinced into going on a relaxing camping trip with Paul and his boyfriend, Noah, she accepts. Little do the friends know, that this trip is going to be anything but relaxing. This soothing, restful trip turns into a hot and erotic workout that ends with something more than they ever expected.Overall, I enjoyed this story very much but I would have liked to see what would have happened once they returned home. The end is kind of happens faster than I expected, but it still leaves me satisfied, as do many of Ms. Bradley's books. This is a short story with some hot and steamy outdoor loving and enough character development that will leave you wanting more.A very reliable source told me this story was loosely based on a true story....so my mind was running wild with what could have happened and couldn't have! ;)",4,1

"Oliver Twist is one of Dickens' most liked and popular novels.Authors, let this be a lesson to you -- create terrific villains.Oliver Twist himself is a twerpy nobody 90% of the books. Okay, he asks for a second bowl of gruel. He fights to defend the good name of his mother. He walks to London in a week. That's all good, but it's all in the first quarter of the book.Afterward he does nothing but get entrapped by criminals. And be such an obvious goody-goody he becomes the friend of the victims instead.Indeed, the man who has a handkerchief stolen by the other two boys, and the family Bill Sykes tries to use Twist to rob turn out to be not only current friends but related to his real family.No author today could get away with such outrageous coincidences.The ending is a sentimental mishmash. He has a half-brother who hates him, and people are involved in complicated plots I could neither follow nor believe.What makes this novel live on is the portrait of Fagin the leader of a gang of child thieves. And the violent robber Bill Sykes and his girlfriend the prostitute (though you have to read between the lines to figure this out), who started with Fagin as a thief when only 4.Although he avoids direct sexual subjects, Dickens otherwise nothing to pretty up the reality of London's underworld of crime and poverty. Dickens got Twist out of this environment as fast as he could, but was wise to keep going back to the criminals, who are the only interesting people in this novel.Dear sweet Oliver and Rose just make us gag.",3,1

"Note: This is the first book I've read from this author.This book had a good storyline and held my interest until the end. However there are parts not everyone would agree with. They seem more animal than human. Bruno has to kill the current alpha in order to gain contol of the pack. To really seal they're bond, Bruno and Renee have sex in shifted form. Not all readers would want to read this and I'm surprised that isn't in the product description. Also a HUGE element that took some getting used to: ALL the females were referred to as bitches, which goes back to them seeming more animal than human. I did like the book and I would not be opposed to reading another book from this series or this author.",4,1
"This author has written two really interesting characters with a nice supporting cast. The heroine is down-on-her-luck, but she's no week little victim. Girl's got backbone. Hero is an admirable military man, handsome, reliable, kind, an alpha without the macho. Two lonely hearts.This book sucked me in right away. ADORED the first half of this book, then it just became, predictable, and hokey. Dissapointed with the non-exsistent love scene. After the author built the sexual tension. I was left with no love scene just a morning after thought of their ""sweet loving"". Entertaining enough but it almost felt like two books. The first half tender, and deep. The second half corny and boring. Sorry not a keeper for me.",3,1

"Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie ""left-handed,"" vs. a truth which is ""right-handed"" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars).",3,1

"My Review:Mya has worked with Milo at an advertising agency, competed with him for accounts,  and been his friend for five years. They started out in Atlanta, but when she realized she was falling in love with him, she decided it was time for a change and headed to the Mirage Agency in DC. Shortly thereafter, Milo was offered a job at the same agency and he accepted the offer and now they are working together again, which is slowly driving Mya insane as she is lusting after him. What she doesn't realize, is that Milo is having the same issues.The tension culminates to a head when the two place a highly sexual bet over an account which results in a weekend full of incredible passion. Milo is trying to figure out how to expand the weekend into much more, but Mya doesn't realize where his head is, and is worried about losing her heart and her friend.This is a hot little book with tons of really passionate loving. These two are best friends, but neither one realizes what the other is thinking which created the tension for the book. I like that they have a highly competitive relationship at work. I thought that it added an interesting element to the story. There was an interesting twist at the end that I really enjoyed with their careers, which I didn't see coming. I also really liked what Andre added to the story and LOVE that his story is next.If you are looking for a hot little read, this is a good one.",4,1
"You don't need 20 words to say Mark Twain is the greatest American author, period. His wit is still witty and his observations of life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries show how little things have really changed.",5,1
"The plot was good; typical beauty and the beast, but with an interesting twist.The story, to me, was a little slow and frustratingly repetitive. At one point th, the same thing was said/question asked at least five times in two paragraphs.At times, the characters were dramatic or cheesy, which I suppose is understandable, so it wasn't a big deal.Also, whoever said this book was like a porn should reevaluate the meaning of the word. The sex scenes were in no way like porn, and were far less descriptive than a few books I've read. They were tasteful.Overall, a decent book.",3,1
"My review is based solely on the first short story as I could not force myself to read the rest.  Three words:  killer plastic bags.  I kid you not.  That's what the first story is about.  I don't think the author intended for the story to be funny, but I couldn't stop laughing.  The idea is so completely ridiculous, it amazes me that it even got published.  Maybe the other stories in the book are better, but I'm never going to know b/c I've already deleted the book from my kindle.",1,0

"Belora lives with her mother in an isolated forest set in a magical andenchanted world. Although she was raised with delightful stories ofdragons and their bonded knights, Belora has never met a dragonfirsthand. When the noble dragon, Kelvan, inadvertently enters herlife, Belora's future takes a sharp turn.Because of Belora's ability to communicate with dragons, Kelvanrecognizes her for the special woman that she is. Believing that shecould very well be a mate for one of the powerful knights, Kelvansnatches her up and takes her to meet his knight, Gareth.Gareth is strong and noble, and resides at the Border Lair with theother fighting dragons and their warrior knights. He has been fightingagainst the evils in his land with Kelvan as his partner, for a longwhile. Upon meeting Belora, Gareth feels instant attraction, and notesthat it is mutual. Because of the shortage of wives for the knights,life in the Border Lair is a far cry from the beliefs with which Belorawas raised. Gareth can only hope that Belora is able to accept thetraditions in the Lair if she recognizes Gareth as her mate.Maiden Flight is a fantasy with a dash of drama and a lot of heat,which completely fascinated me, but not in the way I expected. I wascaptivated by the contradiction between the almost childlike innocenceof the dialogue and the love scenes packed with steamy sexuality. Inone paragraph there would be pure, syrupy words, then in the next I'dbe reading a scorching m&eacute;nage scene that would blow my boots off.Every character is extremely likable, although they seemed almost tooperfect with very few flaws to make them human. I thoroughly enjoyedthe journey of reading Maiden Flight, and loved the bonding between thedragons, the knights and their families. I am definitely lookingforward to any sequels that Ms. D'Arc may later offer.Joliereviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",5,1
First off. when will these writers learn to spell. much less check grammar. constantly trying to figure out what was supposed to be said interrupts the flow. as for the rest. this is stock footage with no depth to characters and plot that has been done to death.,2,0

"This is the second book in the Rachel Myers series.  Rachel moves back from Arizona to the Blue Ridge Mountains after deciding to break it off with her fiance due to her hesitation to commit to marriage.  Before Rachel has finished unpacking, her good friend, Isaac, talks her into investigating the death of another friend of his because he doesn't believe his death is an accident or a suicide.  She also develops a new love interest, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes in future books.  I was happy that the author provided more depth to the main character, Rachel.  She is a likeable but not perfect.  She likes gardening, horses, and horseback riding.  As in the first book in the series, the author's descriptions of the mountain area and town are delightful.  Other reviews have talked about the fact that these books are rather short, and I guess they are.  They are quick and easy reading and very well-written.  Perhaps they are novellas rather than novels, but I have no problem with that.  I will continue to read this series, and I look forward to seeing where Rachel's life leads her.",4,1
This book was very refreshing because it gave an honest portrayal of how families survived in our early western days. I liked the fact that the wife and mother-in-law teamed up to save the day.

"I gave this book four stars in hopes that the rest of the series gets better.  The book makes a good introduction piece but ended suddenly.  The plot was typical and predicable with only one delightful twist and that was that the heroine was deaf.  She did not know she was a wolf and accepted the &#34;unbelievable&#34; stuff way to readily.  The couple had no obstacles to overcome, there were no struggles.  It was love at first sight followed by lots of sex.  This book would be good for a quick, short, steamy read if you were just trying to get excited.  However, Arend does a good job at storytelling.  I just felt that were was no &#34;meat&#34; to the story.  I am going to try the next book with high hopes!",4,1

This book actually had a pretty interesting and not so common storyline regarding the dragon/knight subject matter. I was very excited to see some spicy love story mixed into this interesting world created by the author and was even happier when she threw in the man&egrave;ge as part of the love story... This is also actually where she lost me :-/. Unfortunately Lars was introduced and then quickly incorporated into the relationship without much of a separate set up and that bothered me.

"This is the story of a regular work day at the start of a zombie apocalypse. After getting a sample, I was hooked on the story. The zombies were really different. It still has the shambling zombies, but the story also contains ""smart"" zombies. Each time a zombie feeds it regenerates and gets stronger and smarter. Also some zombies had some pings of humanity. I do not usually like this in my stories. I usually really like the old fashion romero type zombies, but the author did a good job with it so it did work for me. Not bad for an independent book. This book really is in some bad need of editing! I would have given this story a much better rating if not for the mispellings and errors. It is so distracting.",3,1

"Reading a romance novel with a female lead who is neither a passive doormat nor a controlling wench is a refreshing change. Reading a romance novel with a female lead who is confident, capable, smart, and deaf is almost priceless. The male lead is confident, but not controlling or manipulative. He even trusts in Robyn's ability to take care of herself which I really enjoyed. It would have been a five star read for me except the sex is of the flowers and velvet variety, terribly over written, and it detracted from my ability to connect with the story and the characters.

"Dakota Wells is so weary of having to live in fear all the time.  Since her father's death, she has been on her own fighting off her neighbor Ed Franks attempts to buy her spread.  Ed had even managed to have her credit cut off in town, and had intimidated everyone so completely; they refused to sell her any goods at all.  When two gorgeous cowboys showed up looking for work, she was skeptical of their motives right away.  It would not be the first time that Ed had arranged for spies to infiltrate her employment for nefarious purposes.  Dakota normally relied on her gut instinct when it came to her judgment of others, and she honestly didn't believe Joe Taylor and Colt Mason were out to harm her.Joe and Colt were very intrigued with the little spitfire that held them at gunpoint.  They had heard a little about her dire circumstances, and couldn't believe she was still able to stand her ground.  While they were there for personal reasons, helping this woman that got to them, had immediately become paramount.  All three had an immediate connection, and both men intended to explore it wherever it took them.I have enjoyed the Dakota Heat series.  In this offering we are introduced to Dakota, who has had to develop immeasurable strength just to survive.  She has had the weight of the world on her shoulders for so long, she has forgotten what it is like not to live in fear.  She is afraid to believe in the strength and pleasure these men bring into her life.  Dakota is a delightful character written with a hard backbone, but yet she is very vulnerable below the surface.  She is well matched with equally strong men Joe and Colt.  These two men haven't lived an easy life, and even though they have every reason to have hardened hearts, with Dakota, they are whole and loving.  There are some very erotic passages that will leave your blood boiling that the author has crafted within a good story.  This is a recommended read!",4,1
"I love the city of N'awlins & am immediately drawn to any story which draws on the city for inspiration.  When I started reading this book, the 10-year old voodoo-relate CRIME of a child killing her mother drew me in, & I looked forward to reading what I thought would be a story in which the practice of voodoo would play a predominant role.  That , unfortunately, was not the case at all.  Having now read the whole book, I have to say that I am really not sure what the book was about - just a lot of senseless killings that had some tenuous link, at best, to the original 10-yr old murder that actually had nothing to do with voodoo.  Additionally, except for Val, the characters were not at all relatable. And, as noted by other reviewers, sloppy grammar/punctuation permeated the book.",2,0

"With Ylesia, a novella originally published in e-book form, Walter Jon Williams gets an opportunity to insert further story into his novel Destiny's Way. The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.Yleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.For the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.  Ylesia is a solid enough little story but I would only recommend it to someone going through the entire New Jedi Order and wanting a little more.",2,0
"Heather is the human mate of Cael and Riyu.  While out with her father-In-law, they are attacked by hunters and with his dying breath, Cael and Riyu's father mistakenly blames Heather for his wounds.  When Heather stumbles into the pack, instead of being comforted, she is cast aside by her mates who believe she is the reason for the death of their father.  Heather is unable to fathom why her father-in-law would lie but is even more confused as to why her mates would believe she would do something so vile.  So, Heather does what her mates ask of her even though her heart is breaking and her body is weak.  She leaves.I bet I used a box of tissues with this baby.  Talk about emotional.  I swore after the first scene that I would hate Cael and Riyu until the end of the book.  Honestly? I hated them for about five minutes.  Then I became immersed in their saga to find their mate and make amends.  I wanted them to beg for forgiveness and my hateful inner woman wanted Heather to never forgive them.  But, the power of love won out and it made for a tremendous Christmas story of love and forgiveness.There are many reasons why I love to read Maya Banks.  A book like Love Me Still is just one of them.",5,1
I loved this DBMS book!  Wonderful and a little hard to follow at first but once you get reading you can't put it down! Can't wait to read the next one,5,1

"Reread in October 2012 and dropped rating from 3 stars to 2.I really have to wonder why I rated this book 3 stars in the first place. There was one really good line in it and the rest was eye-rolling, groan-worthy, or both. The good line? ""Confused and fearful as he was, this one thing Tom knew for certain. No man ever took another man's balls in his mouth to mock him.""It gets a bit spoilery below, so keep reading if you don't mind that sort of thing.----The rest of it? A-hole Law apparently experienced love at first sight with Tom and his heart was positively broken to discover Tom shacked up with Law's cousin. Oh poor little rich boy! Once Tom's single, A-hole Law swoops in and carries Tom off, then proceeds to do something that looked disturbingly like date rape.But the Magic Peen is magic, and after being date raped Tom is now head-over-heels in love with Law. It was like reading an 80s Harlequin, complete with purple prose and ""rape her (or him as the case may be) until she love you"". Blech. Various things happen after that, with Tom experiencing agonies thinking his love is not returned. Because God forbid Law actually talk to him, or communicate with him at all. But then - surprise! - it turns out Law has loved him all along and whisks him off to HEA.Oh yeah, and somewhere in there was an utterly unrealistic scene on a Harley. Law never rides motorcycles, but somehow has the skill to ride a Harley as if it were a sportbike in the hands of a racer. Uh huh. Ugh.",2,0

"I am committed to reviewing every book I read because, as a writer myself, I appreciate the hard work that goes into turning out a piece of work and the wish for as many reviews as is humanly possible. This novel had me in two minds. I liked the story but I lost track of who was who when characters came in and out of the tale, in a somewhat disjointed way. Having said that, the tale was intriguing and I was pleased that I didn't manage to predict the ending. I also partly agree with one reviewer in that, once we know the main character is black, there's no need to keep making references alluding to there perhaps being some special significance that we never get to the bottom of, and which has nothing whatsoever to do with the story. It could have been anyone as far as I'm concerned. I hope, for the author's sake, that I've made a fair comment.",3,1

I paid for this and was VERY disappointed to find that it was only about 20 pages. SHAME on Amazon for charging for this short story that I read in about 10 minutes.

So many good stories in this collection. Konrath is the master story teller with a vivid imagination and can create a well rounded fleshed out character in just a couple of paragraphs.,5,1
This was a very intense book. It followed a group of Vampires. It told the story of each vampire and his or her &#34;chosen&#34;. I felt the portrayal of the vampires was interesting. The males were very HOT!!!! and the females very enticing!!! I truly enjoyed all the stories. The only thing I would caution is that you really must love Vampires and all things vampires to enjoy this book!!!!,5,1
"I confess that I did not get very far into this story before I deleted it from my Kindle.In this day and age, there is absolutley no excuse whatsoever for bad spelling and atrocious grammar in ANY written work. There is no reason to have a hy-phenated word in the middle of a line...see that example. Things like that annoy me no end(I should have been a proof-reader...I know that I would have done a much, much better job), and to that end, I just pushed the button.Honestly, I think the story could have been good...I wouldn't have bought it otherwise.If I had to give it a mark out of 10? The answer would be a 2. Frankly, I'm embarrassed for the author. Shame!!",2,0

"When I was a child my parents loved these stories - made into several movies - and of course, I thought they were boring and old fashioned.Well, they're still old fashioned, but in a comforting, old world way.  The stories are set in the British Isles for the most part, between WWI and WWII.  Bulldog Drummond makes a habit of saving damsel's in distress with flair and dash.  There's no bad language, course innuendo or explicit sex or violence, just interesting narrative and story lines.  Great for a quiet rainy Sunday.",3,1
I liked these stories very much.  Bulldog wages unconventional war against unconventional criminals and succeeds using methods that are noble but normal police cannot use.  I enjoy his 'bigger than life' personality and abilities and recommend this for a truly enjoyable read.Richard Pendleton,5,1
"Stop on in to Murray's truck stop & take part in this psychotic thriller. Take a whacked out trucker, a courier, a truck stop hooker & a lady cop then sit back & enjoy. The short story is a very dark tale, but good. The trucker & courier are a couple of sicko serial killers. Everyone meets by pure chance at Murray's.A satisfying read, it's quick & to the point. No wasted dialogue.The only issues have nothing to do with the author or story. The editing in the Kindle edition is very sloppy. Additionally at 56% the novella ends. The rest is a Q&A; session with the author. That in itself is misleading",4,1
"I subscribe to both Analog Science Fiction and Fact and [Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine].  My Kindle subscriptions, delivered via the Kindle app on my iPad, save me from myself.  Instead of hunting down magazines at the bookstore--or wondering where they disappeared to from the mail--I just wait for them to show up.  Nice, low-fuss delivery.  And then instant reading gratification.Analog has about half of the science fiction content of its competitor.  It makes up for this with more information from the ""Fact"" side of the fence.  The factual articles, editorials and letters to the editor are interesting and occasionally very interesting.  They wouldn't stand on their own, but are worth the subscription price when bundled with the fiction.My personal take:  I like reading on devices like the iPhone and iPad that also hold a lot of legitimate, technical information.  Maybe I'm just kidding myself when I think I'm getting away with it, but I do enjoy reading Analog and Asimov's in a long, boring, all-hands work meeting.The recommendation:  If you only subscribe to one Kindle magazine for science fiction, make it [Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine].  If you have the extra time, subscribe to this magazine as well.  It's a good complement with a real-science emphasis less present in Asimov's.",3,1
"The plot of the story was very promising.  The first several chapters kept me interested and I couldn't wait to see what happened.  But that was where the problem lie.  I felt like a waited and waited and waited to see what would happen.  About half way through the book the dialogue became utterly boring and I didn't think I would ever reach the end. When I did reach the end, I felt let down. The grammar was pretty bad so if you are not able to overlook errors you might not want to even try this one.",2,0

"Aptly titled, ""Second Chance Romance"" follows high school and college sweethearts Kip Turner and Mandy Green, who after 11 years still carry a torch for each other. With both of them now 30 years old, with Kip a successful professional hockey player who plays for the NHL while Mandy is a school teacher and single mom, they reconnect through Facebook and find themselves searching for their happily-ever-after.Great premise for a beautiful love story. Unfortunately, the telling was flat and the characters remained two-dimensional until the end. And though this book is classified erotica, and I would rate this M for mature audience only because of sex and language use, classifying this erotica is using the term loosely.Erotica as a genre already has a lot of detractors. And of course, those who read erotica already knows that it can go either way, one extreme is that it is outright porn, while the other end of the spectrum is that erotica is a beautiful story wherein sex scenes are part of the telling and it will not be complete without it. Case in point, ""In the Realm of the Senses"", a 1976 Franco-Japanese romantic drama film directed by Nagisa Oshima, is perhaps one of the best examples of the erotica genre.""Second Chance Romance"" has all the elements of the latter side of the spectrum of the genre. An exciting hero who is not just good looking but very athletic; a painfully shy heroine who blossomed as she gained more confidence as the love story proceeds. Unfortunately, the book fell short on everything about storytelling.And that is the reason why I am really disappointed that the story and the characters remained flat. There really was no climax to speak of; the struggles were minimal and though we know that Kip and Mandy deserve their HEA, the telling of how they got there left a lot to be desired.So, why the two star rating instead of one? Just like the lesson of the book, everyone deserves a second chance. And I hope that the author takes this as a constructive criticism and that she continues to write as she improves on her craft.",2,0

"Another thriller from this author, and as usual, no shortage of gruesomeness. Jack finds herself at a truck stop in the middle of nowhere and is accosted by a tag-team of two serial killers, each with their own sick method of torture and killing. Good set up, good story, but it was over too quickly. Could have drawn out the climax a bit more, IMO.(Note: The story ends at about 56% on my Kindle...the rest is a self-interview and excerpts from some of his other books...several of which will no doubt be downloaded soon!)",4,1
"This is an excellent thriller.  It presents an interesting story that is well written. The hero has some unique talents, strong planning abilities and an uncommon amount of courage.

I liked getting to know Kaylee's background and finding out just how she got sent to the mental hospital.  I also liked how we got to meet a character in the hospital, Lydia, which ties to a character in the fifth book I just read, If I Die.  But I think the way Lydia was written in the prequel was a little confusing.  Even though I understood her character, because I just read the fifth book, I still had a hard time understanding what was happening with her scene.  I liked reading this short little, but significant, blip in Kaylee's life before she understands what is happening to her.",3,1

"Because I liked the way the story started I hope book one is a teaser.  There seems to be a trend (please make it go away) to publish chapter-like books that require buying the chapters under the guise of buying books in a series.  (Why not just sell them labeled as chapters?)  I digress.I was emotionally hooked with the beginning.  I can understand that this book was not about Steele and plan to read the next book and have all my hopes for the story are realized--sort of like 'the rest of the story'.  Stand alone, this book was entertaining and I would enjoy it in a waiting room but certainly not enough to spend 'I want a good book to read' money.I like that what was told of the story was easy to follow, easy to buy into.  I say that hoping that in the next 'chapters', the story are about Steele, how he came to be the man he has evolved into and what kind of partner criteria he has that meant he was wide open and available when she came along?  There was nothing about Steele in this book.  He was a boy, then he is a man, a force to be reckoned with in her living room.  I want to see them become not just lovers but a well oiled team as well.There is more, right?",3,1

"As with any &#34;frontier&#34; the American west had its share of opportunists, dreamers, hard working folks, bigger than life characters, and dangerous misfits.  The book explores lesser known outlaws and lawmen and takes away the layers of myth surrounding many well known characters like Jessee James and Billy the Kid.  Pat Garrett's life was interesting and his interview about tracking and killing Billy the Kid told it like it was.  For anybody with an interest in America's frontier days this is a great read.",5,1

"This was a quickie. There wasn't much story or background or development... But since it was a short story and the first one in the series, I was okay with that. I figured the second book would make up for the missing pieces. The love between Atticus and Lissa was pretty much instantaneous. Honestly, if you read the synopsis above, you can almost skip the book. I almost feel like it's longer than the book... you know, minus the X rated parts. I guess you'd have to read the book for the X rated part. Which was good, by the way. But, aside from that, there really wasn't much to it... I don't even know what else to say. I guess, if you're just looking for a quick sex scene, then you might enjoy this.

"""Angel Be Good"" is a modern day take on ""A Christmas Carol."" The two main characters, Nat and Daphne, spend the night reviewing Nat's life and working on changing his attitude toward the world. I really like Daphne. The author spent time and effort developing her character. But it didn't seem as much effort was put into Nat. His character facilitated too often to make him believable. Like any ""Christmas Carol"" story, you want to see the person come to a epiphany that changes their character and makes the world a better place. This story reached that point a little too easily and a little too dramatically -- You need a kidney? Here take one of mine.Overall, it was an easy story to read, get into, and stay in, despite a few minor shortcomings.",3,1
I found nothing to like in this short description of torture and murder. The idea that anyone can feel justify to take another's life for their own justice is disturbing.

"Once upon a time two cousins, Colin and Beckett de Saxby vied for the affections of the lovely Christiana. After they are grown things change. Beckett becomes the Earl of Dareford, Colin fights as a knight and Christiana works her lands under the Earl's care, while Beckett turns down every offer for her hand.When Beckett decides Christiana must move back inside the castle walls she reluctantly agrees. Then Beckett takes her to his bed and masters her with his touch. Times are turbulent, though, and an evil nobleman is taking estates in an effort to undermine the King. A masked man known as the Blacksmith fights back.When Christiana is kidnapped the Blacksmith comes to her rescue. What follows next is a maelstrom of events at the castle that threaten to break both Beckett and Christiana's hearts.The Heat of the Knight is a tantalizing tale of love and lust. Beckett is a tortured hero that appealed to my romantic soul, and his love for Christiana was genuine. The heat in the title is aptly featured in the story with scenes of m/f/f/f and anal sex. I highly recommend The Heat of the Knight for those who like their historical romance mixed with a great deal of erotica.Note: The Heat of the Knight was previously published and has been revised from its original release.AmeliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",5,1

"Yes it was free, and that's the only reason I ""purchased"" it.  I don't know precisely why, but I never felt connected to the story.  There was a lot of time and space devoted to sex between the two main characters in the book (far too much space, actually), but the characters never pulled me into the story at all.  The basic premise of the book just never caught my interest, and I didn't really care about what was happening or any of the characters.  If I had to put my finger on what was wrong about this book, it would be that there was hardly any back-story to the characters.  The author also relied on conclusive statements that seemed to come out of the blue, rather than letting the characters' motivations and reasoning evolve naturally through the story.It was actually a chore to get myself to finish reading the book, starting from about a third of the way into it.  Not that the first third of the book was any better - that's just how long I would give an author to warm up and hook me into their story.  The sex scenes were too frequent and too long, to the point that the underlying story was never developed in any meaningful way.  It's ebooks like this that make me miss the ability to jump ahead in a paper book, quickly flipping past several pages until I can see where a particularly boring scene has ended and the story picks up again.  I would not read any sequel to this book, even if it were free.  I wouldn't try another, unrelated story by the same author, unless perhaps it, too, was free.",1,0

"Brody Nash has the perfect idea for the one year anniversary of his relationship with his girlfriend Sidney - a m&eacute;nage with his best friend Drew.  Brody loves Sidney and sharing her with anyone would never have even come up if he hadn't noticed that some of her preferred reads involve m&eacute;nage relationships.Drew Buchanan isn't the settling down kind of guy and he never stays with any one woman for very long.  He leads more of a nomadic lifestyle and often sails off on his yacht aptly named `Sunset.'  He's a brilliant desert chef and creates his delectable treats for Brody's restaurant, The Blue Fish Grill, whenever he's in Graceville but he's finding it harder and harder to stay in town especially since he's in love with Sidney.Sidney McCall has always lived a nomadic lifestyle.  Her mother never stayed in one place very long and she simply continued the lifestyle she already knew - until she met Brody.  They quickly moved from the initial meeting to living together and even a year after the fact, Sidney still feels like it's all a dream.In celebration of their first anniversary together Sidney plans to surprise Brody with a delicious meal along with a sexy outfit when he returns home from the restaurant - and succeeds.  Brady had intended to tell Sidney that he'd invited Drew over and about his surprise but one look at her in her sexy dress and all his brain cells headed south.  Dinner's put on hold while they satisfy other hungers - until they hear the knock at the door and then Brody remembers that he still has to tell her about his `gift.'  Sidney can't deny an attraction to Drew and even though she isn't entirely comfortable with the idea of sex with two men at the same time it is a fantasy of hers and if it's alright with the men then who is she to argue.  Things turn decidedly odd afterwards and Sidney's not sure what to think about Drew's cold disinterested attitude and to make things even more complicated Brody notices her preoccupation and assumes that it's more than just friendly concern.Sami Lee delves into what could happen when the thing you fantasize about turns out to be the exact opposite of what you truly desire.  Sidney and Brody are deeply in love with each other but neither of them are truly certain of the others feelings.  I found the dynamics between these three characters to be oddly fascinating but at the same time understand why Drew's held himself apart from Brady and Sidney.  I'd love to know what happened with Drew after this story ends.  He's a special guy who deserves a little happiness in his life and a special woman.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",5,1
"I really enjoyed this book. This book has all the greats, romance,fights, turmoil, and then the love. The author is great I can't wait to find more of hers!",5,1

An erotic themed book with a plot ! Christina comes from abusive alcoholic family that she has been attempting to escape. While she is leaping into a new relationship with two men - her life falls apart around her. Jon and JT support her through the chaois. It was nice quick read - that gave you a little bit of everything.,5,1

"A balding, 60-year-old who lives with his mother is our unlikely but lovable hero! When some of his classmates from high school start getting killed, he launches his own un-official investigation which drives the local police crazy. It had just the right amount of humor and suspense to build a fine story. It was going along at a five-star pace, but the ending had, in my unique opinion, some unnecessary twists and turns which added a little to the story line. This is not to say that overall it wasn't a great book, it is just that it could have ended successfully in about 30 or so fewer pages. The main character, however, made the book and is firmly locked in my memory!",4,1
"Katie and Cutter...what a journey. Almost too little too late. Men are so full of themselves that they usually miss the most important parts of life. Glad they seemed to work it out, but there's more of their story to tell, I'm sure or should I say ""I hope""? Good story.",3,1
"For close to five years now Saul Hunter has left his home every Friday evening telling his mate Ryce Hunter that he was going out to get laid.  Saul doesn't return home until Saturday morning, exhausted and quiet.Ryce decides to go out to a bar himself after Saul leaves once again on a Friday night.  If Saul can do it then so can Ryce.  What Ryce doesn't expect to find is that he has a Tri Omega mate too when he spots Carrington `Cary' Jones.With a special mate like Cary however, there are possible problems.  Ryce has no trouble permanently claiming Cary but Saul must claim him as well for a true tri-mating to occur.  Ryce and Saul already have big problems so adding Cary to the mix might spell disaster for an already teetering mating.  What if Saul refuses to claim Cary?  What that would mean for the three of them is unthinkable.Sexy wolves and carnal lovemaking gives readers exactly what they are looking for in Stolen Desires.  This is the fourth story in the Tri Omega Mates series and can be read as a stand alone tale.  The romance between Ryce and Cary is tender when needed and rough when necessary.  Also, the emotional turmoil Saul experiences is felt in Stolen Desires.  I think that editing out a bit  of the way through would have kept the suspense and secret more interesting.  It takes too long to find out Saul's big secret which takes away from an otherwise very enjoyable tale.  Having said that, fans of the series won't be disappointed and new readers are certain to find Stolen Desires very entertaining!LisaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",4,1

"My biggest problem with this book is that I liked both Sam and Marabeth better at the beginning of the book than I did at the end.At the beginning of the book Sam is a protective but sexy alpha male.  By the middle of the book he's extremely controlling and is playing little headgames with Marabeth that make me want to kick him almost as much as she wants to kick him.  And by the end of it, he's more than controlling, he's also patronizing.At the beginning of the book Marabeth is a strong-willed woman who has an unfortunate attraction to a man that she doesn't want to be attracted to.  In the middle of the book she's fighting for recognition from both her father and her soon-to-be husband - not just recognition, but respect.  She's fighting the good fight, demanding answers, working on projects for the good of the country and insisting that Sam stop treating her like a child and that he respect her work.By the end of the book she has given up everything to him.  She's incensed about how he doesn't listen to her, the fact that he's pursuing a project directly opposed to one of hers, and his constant patting on her head and acting like she's bubblehead... but as soon as he admits his love to her who cares about all that?  Hey, he said the L word... all those other problems? Big deal?!  We never get to see how they work out any of those issues, what happens with their conflicting projects, or whether Sam ever starts treating her if she has any brains.  The story is over with as soon as she knows what his feelings are towards her.Well you can love a dog, but that doesn't mean that you'll treat it as your equal.  Since that was what Marabeth was fighting for the entire book it was pretty upsetting to me when she surrendered in the ninth round, apparently not caring that none of the issues she's constantly pushing Sam about have been addressed.  I hope she doesn't expect him to change into a caring man who respects her opinions and ideas after the wedding, cuz he didn't even compromise about that before it.",2,0

This is an ok read.  This story line is set in the 1930's and detective Dance is the protagonist.  Dance is a trust fund baby who has been exiled by his parents due to photos of him and a boyfriend.  Detective Dancy is given several cases throughout this novel which are interesting as are his friends and employees.  Again this is an ok read but I prefer Jesse and Tim from his Big Boy detective stories.,3,1
"Given that our tastes and reading habits change over the years, all I could think about was that I would have found these essays and this humor mildly (and I mean mildly) amusing back in the 60s.

"This was a short and sweet fairy tale romance.Fiona fell in love with Garret. After she moved in with him, he changed. He started slapping her, and hurting her. She waited for him to leave for work one day, and climbed into her old car and headed for Texas from Colorado. During her trip she swerved to miss hitting a dog, then she passed out. Aidan stopped to help her. He realized her car was about to break down. So he offered her a ride to his home, a job, and a place to stay for a little while. They thought it would be better if they pretended to be a couple. While they were pretending, they both fell in love with one another. Meanwhile her ex was still harassing her, and threatening her. The suspense of the story was Garret finding her. I was glad Aidan was there to give her support, and his love. The chemistry seemed between Fiona and Aidan seemed real, but the time line was too fast for it to happen in real life. It did make for a nice fairy tale.",4,1

"An alpha discovering his mate is an omega is a theme explored by several writers, but this story has some special twists.  The author incorporates the struggle between being true to one's long-time friends versus the sudden, overwhelming pull of the mating bond, along with a healthy dose of pack roles and intimate encounters with some healthy, hot m&eacute;nage twists.  Those twists definitely have me interested in reading more in this series.",3,1

"Count Albritton is a paranormal private investigator. For example, he helps people figure out if they are really stalked by a vampire and what to do about it. As the story begins, we find Count in a hospital,  a would-be assassin with a pillow and a knife at his side. Soon, he is embroiled with a lot more than saving his own skin.On the plus side, there is a great cast of characters from the supernatural world : guardian angel, immortals, demons, sorcerers, vampires,in a sort of D&D-ish; world where it's all about the mission and not a lot of thought is put into planing.On the minus side, I was annoyed with the many flashbacks. Going back and forth was really confusing and the connections between now an then were awkward. On at least two occasions, I found myself going back a few pages, trying to figure out just what was going on. There is also a lot left unexplained and probably not on purpose. It felt more like the author had the basis of his novel so clear in his head that he forgot that we didn't know what came before or who (or what) the characters really are.For the same atmosphere, I suggest the Sandman Slim novels. There are better crafted and the writting is way superior.",3,1

"This book is the sequel to The Inconvenient Duchess and focuses on the villain of that book.  After leaving with the emerald necklace the Duchess gave him, he had joined the army and served with distinction.  After he leaves the army, he must live one year scandal free if he wants a reward offered to him by the Prince Regent.Esme Danville lives with her abusive father who wants to marry her off to a man his age, if not older and just as abusive. Seeing no way out, she decides to become someone's mistress and thus get the marriage called off.  After seeing St. John breaking up with his mistress without laying a hand on her, she decides he is the one she wants.  After hearing her outlandish and most unladylike proposal, he refuses and ends up taking her to his brother's house, a place he is not welcome.  They do agree that they may stay under certain conditions.  The duchess tries to introduce her to eligible men without success.  Esme only has eyes for St. John who is trying to live down his infamous and deal with an addiction to laudanum he uses to deal with wartime memories.  It is hard to ignore Esme and his resolve slowly starts to crumble.After their inevitable return to London, Esme has to endure abuse from her father and despairs of not seeing St. John again.  He does get the reward and faces one challenge after another to  rescue her and get their happily ever after.Because I always wanted to know what happened to him after the end of the first book, I went ahead and bought this one.I think it is good and it kept my attention, something not all Regencies do.  I do recommend it to others who read the first book not only because of  St. John, but also shows how the people in the first book have prospered.

"You know, I hardly EVER give a book one star. But this book...*sigh* where do I start?First off, I'm not against light reads. I read my share of them and most of the time find them enjoyable. But there's light and there's light. This is dandelion fluff light. So light that the plot seems to have blown away into thin air.M. L. McClure has her share of devotees but I should have listened more closely to the reviews. Very few comment on the plot. It's just ""all about the kissing"". And folks, seriously, it is. I mean, there's little else. It's like the author draws two characters(so they can kiss) Oh no! Make it four; (you know, more to kiss); there. Ok, now where can they kiss? Lets see...how about a prairie kiss? Then lets go to the river and have a river kiss? Hey, meet me by the barn and we'll kiss again! And have you seen the tree house? Well, let me SHOW you! *kiss kiss*. It was THE WHOLE STORY!!! And each kiss (and lead up) may be two or three PAGES!.Hey, I like romance as much as the next person but give us a REASON TO CARE.And it was so Disney. Enter poor clumsy heroine and hero hunk. Hero hunk loves poor clumsy heroine over all others (though he can have his pick) for no reason other than she's adorable and  he's older and wiser (and can teach her to kiss). He rescues her non stop through every scrape. She falls in a mud puddle. Guess who's there to pull her out? Enter abusive Daddy, Prairie Prince to the rescue!She's being chased by murderers, have no fear, Prairie Prince is here (on his stallion no less).*SPOILER*  They kissed.The one redeeming feature of this book is it's short.

"I would not say I liked or disliked this story. I don't mind a real short one once in a while, but it is really difficult with romance because I really want more character development and more time to understand their relationship. I liked the hero and heroine, but I think I am going to stick to the regular length romance. They are still a short read, between 4 and 5 hours, but the characters are so much more developed. I can't complain though as it only cost 99 cents.",3,1
"In a nutshell:I'm going to purchase the next book and see where it leads.I feel like the primary character needed to have a bit more age and experience... and perhaps a little more inertia to his intellect rather than just constantly winging it and winning against a clever antagonist.Felt kinda like ""I grew up in the outback, now I'm kicking butt""Maybe something bridging or providing background... (another novel?) that would kinda put some meat on the character?I guess I'm saying the character's 'awesomeness' was explained in a rather uninspiring fashion.The setting is fairly well done.  The background characters are likable, even the bad guys.  Characters behave in a way that is quite reasonable to their personality and interests (ie, bad guys *not* making stupid mistakes by supposed overconfidence, the crutch of bad storytelling).",4,1
"Although the story line is not bad, this author continuously had Native Americans who could barely speak English, thinking in complex English words and phrases...I highlighted a few in my kindle as examples...but one which really sticks out is when when of the native americans was thinking she was feeling queasy...simply not believable that someone who can barely speak English would think using the word queasy...I found myself thinking of how the thoughts could have been expressed in simpler English that you would have beleived the characters were thinking (rather than being caught up in the story)...this is throughout the book and really takes away from your enjoyment...It is clear from the preface that the writer was not going for any authenticity as she has the ceremony described as taking place years after the last ceremony was really performed (when all it would have taken was for her to change the date on the first page of when this happened--the date did not affect the story at all)....clearly this writer did not care for the book to sound authentic...but having the Native Americans ""think"" (and sometimes speak) in perfect and complex English was annoying and took away from the story...Here is one such time copied verbatim from the book...this is an Indian Girl thinking to herself during childbirth...but at this point this girl barely speaks English""It was almost done.  One more push and this process would be over!""  Process?another""You need focus on rabbit""  this from an Indian who just knew enough English to trade with the white man...Focus? surely not a word someone who barely speaks English would uselater on the Chief says""We suggest you leave""  Again, just not believable...There were many many more examples...but it was only 3/4 (or more) of the way through the book it ticked me off enough to decide to write a review...so I saved a couple of examples that were short...This book was mildly entertaining, and did have a few unexpected twists, but the language she had the Native Americans who could barely speak English using was simply unforgivable and is really distracting as you are constantly thinking ""An Indian would not have said or thought that""I suggest this writer put a little more imagination into her writing, especially if she is going to do more books about Native Americans...simply not believable and ruins the whole book.",2,0

"I stopped reading at 62%.  I'm not sure if I can even say for certain why I stopped other than I didn't care about the protagonist.  Kevin, Boltman, is either crazy or a superhero but there wasn't enough character building done for me to get anything real about him other than he's a geek with a possibly tenuous grasp on reality.  I felt that same about the other characters - the love interest, the best friend, the washed out actor (who's habit of speaking exclusively in the third person REALLY annoyed me) and the cult leader - I didn't feel any of them were real people.I found myself reading just to get through the book and not because I wanted to know what was going to happen to these characters I didn't really care about.

"Private Property by Leah Braemel is the first book in the Hauberk Security series. It is also Leah's first published work and I enjoyed it so much I knew I'd read anything future she published. The characters are interesting, the dialog engaging, and the sex scenes are hot. What truly enamored me though was the fact that this book takes place less than a half of a mile from my home and she described it perfectly.This book centers around Mark Rodgriguez and Jodi Tyler. Mark is the owner of Celeda Security located in Texas and Jodi one of his operatives. The book opens with Jodi staking out a home she is suppose to break into to prove to the owner that his current security company isn't any good and they should hire Mark's company. Jodi is upset that Mark chose her to head up this security breach since it's her birthday and she'd rather spend the evening with him. She begins to think that perhaps this is Mark's way of breaking off their ""no strings"" relationship. What we soon find out is that Mark has set up an evening with his old college roommate and friend, Sam Watson, (owner of Hauberk Security) to help him fulfill some of Jodi's fantasies as a birthday gift. The tables are turned on Mark and he soon realizes that he has been an idiot when it comes to Jodi.This is a very good book, Mark is a likeable albeit at times kind of clueless hero. He thinks he has his relationship with Jodi all figured out but in reality he doesn't. It takes Sam, some restraints, and some interesting situations to make him see things differently.Jodi is capable, extremely likeable, but very insecure. She's dated some losers in the past that have made it difficult to trust and thus she's always waiting for Mark to dump her. She's feeling guilty because she agreed to an unemotional affair with Mark but she's fallen in love with him.I like both Mark and Jodi, but Sam is the one that stole the show in this book. From the minute he came on the scene I was hooked and knew that I had to know more about this complex man. Considering all the ""fun"" things he has in his home, you just know there is a great story behind him.For a first book, Private Property is very good but it left me wanting more. While the story is complete, I knew that I'd have to read the next one as soon as it was available. I always love when I find a writer that I ""mesh"" with right away and Leah is one of those authors. I'm very happy to give this first effort a solid 4 stars.***NOTE*** As I was reading I felt myself wanting to know more about Mark and Jodi and was pleased when I got to the end and found there was a free read (First Night) detailing the beginning of Mark and Jodi's relationship. It answered a lot of questions and helped me understand the characters so much more. You can find this at Leah's website.",4,1

"""Serial"" is a great little collaborative effort by two entertaining writers.  Chapter one shows the grandfatherly-looking serial killer known simply as ""Donaldson"" torture and kill a hapless hitchhiker that he picks up at a rest stop.  Chapter two shows a woman serial killer named Lucy torture and kill two guys who picked HER up hitchhiking.  Chapter three is serial killer Donaldson giving a ride to serial killer Lucy, and the fun begins.The story is graphic and visceral and not for the squeamish, but don't worry- it's not torture porn.  Jack Kilborn (who's really thriller writer J.A. Konrath) and Blake Crouch are pros who know how to tell a story, not talentless hacks just describing an ax falling and hacking off limbs (not that there are scenes as unimaginative as a simple ax attack here).  Yes, you will graphically be told what implement, say, Donaldson decides to use against his victim, and, yes, you are clearly told what Donaldson does with the implement.  But the facts are related quickly, without excruciating detail.  The rest is all in the reader's head.  Kilborn and Crouch give us what our neurons need to know to get started, and sit back and let us fill in the rest.  That's why it's such a hoot to read some of these other Amazon reviews that complain about the ""too graphic"" nature of ""Serial"".  In the end, these nastily clever guys realize that good horror writing- even graphic horror- ultimately comes from a formula of one part writer and three parts reader.""Serial"" is about the length of a longish story in ""Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine"", and- truth be told- could probably appear there with only a little re-writing to tone it down from its current Hard-R or NC-17 tone.  After all, most of the story consists of interesting character exchanges (lots of dark-tinged banter, especially), moments of clever set-up, and plenty of good suspense... all things that have to do with decent writing and not graphic bloodletting.After the story's over, ""Serial"" is rounded out by a fun, illuminating  chat between the two authors and moody, entertaining excerpts from two of their books, making the whole package good for an hour or two of edgy entertainment on the couch or porch. Even if ""Serial"" goes up to a buck or so from its current bargain price of ""free"", this would still be a worthwhile download for your Kindle.",5,1

"The plot had potential..it was believable..unfortunately the author missed it.  It was still a fairly good read.  I am happy it was free on my Kindle Fire.  I am not sure who to blame for the many many typos or lost sentences.  There were times I would have to read a paragraph over and over again to figure out what was trying to be said.Having been in a Love/Hate relationship before I found the relationship between Kasey and Chay believable but, I fear other readers would be lost and/or would lose interest.I am willing to read another book from this author before I cast final judgement as to if I would be willing to pay my hard earned money on purchasing another book from her.",3,1

"Our favorite gay medium, Vic Bayne, returns in the 2nd installment of the Psycop series. Unwilling to go back to his apartment where the incubus almost killed him and was turned into a mass of protoplasm (""Among the Living"", the first novel), Jacob has moved in with Vic and both are testing the waters of cohabitation. In each character's mind, they realize this may or may not be temporary as neither has broached the subject of actually living together. Vic's friend Lisa is now in training at PsyTrain, and he has been assigned a new partner, Roger Burke, a rather affable eager-to-please who accepts Vic and his sexuality all in stride. This all seems well enough, and things should be going well for Vic, except that his psychic ability has gone into hyperactive mode. The dead are now clearly visible everywhere, and they seek him out when he's around. Constantly reaching for him, he can actually physically feel them and starts to lose control and break down.It's a very enjoyable story. Vic is a wonderfully complex character, and his sarcastic wit gives the story a lighter edge when needed. As with any good story, Vic undergoes some growth, which adds to the empathy one can feel for him. Too many serial stories don't let their characters grow, trying to keep them the same as they were in the first book, so it's pleasant when you can see and chart the growth Vic is gradually going through. Other characters aren't quite as fleshed out as Vic is, but they're still interesting and enjoyable. The story stumbles a little at times by stretching plausibility (like the introduction of a device that lets Vic tune in or tune out spirits, which raises more questions as to the nature of the spirits than it answers), but overall, it's an immensely interesting and enjoyable novel.",4,1

"I look for bundled series for the Kindle and was pleasantly surprised with this one. A historical fiction featuring a heroine that is coming into her own, it manages to have romance without dragging sex into it too much (so far in the series) and a plausible mystery.  It manages to keep the heroine within character for her timeline rather than making her a modern-day woman in a corset and bustle.",4,1

"**warning*** this review has some spoilersIt's not just the characters who are frustrated throughout the book, it was myself as well.I had high hopes for the story line, it was a novel approach and I enjoyed reading a romance from this time period set in Bath rather than in London. The main characters are engaging and the writing style is well done. But then the frustrations start.First of all,  Lady Iona is downright awful at anything approaching communication. She lets her family shut her up all the time, even when her very happiness depends on it. And then she constantly thinks about telling Nathan the truth about her father's plan to engage her to her cousin, but she never actually brings it up. It takes her forever to explain to him why she won't marry him. And then once he insists on the marriage, even after he's told her how impressed he is with her artwork and how he'll support her in the endeavor, she immediately starts assuming that he'll crush the happiness out of her and not let her do the things she wants to do. I have NO idea where she got that idea, and she never even asks him about it! I'm not really sure who she was rebelling against... it mostly seemed to be like she was rebelling against her assumptions rather than what people actually wanted/expected from her.Not that Nathan's much better at communication, but at least he tries to talk to HER even if he doesn't clear up things with his family - not that they're listening to him anyway.She's also more than a little bit selfish, but even once she realizes that she's behaving selfishly, she doesn't stop! And she behaves more than a little recklessly, putting herself in danger in ways that IF she truly had spent time helping women of the lower classes like she says she does, then she would know better. I understand wanting to make her seem innocent and naive, but in a lot of the situations she goes way too far and it just becomes ludicrous.And then we have the ridiculous about turn of her family.  Not only did her mother warn off Nathan from her - long before he had truly become a rake, and we never get a real explanation for that... unless the rumor about him ruining another girl was out beforehand? but even then, why would the DUCHESS be the one visiting and telling him that, shouldn't it be up to Iona's father? - but her father goes from punching Nathan in the face one night and insisting that she must marry her cousin as he's planned, to the next morning hearing Nathan out and then declaring that Iona must marry Nathan to save HIS reputation? Why on earth does her father suddenly believe Nathan's accounting of events? Out of freaking NOWHERE?!There is a good story within this book, unfortunately it's hampered by way too many obstacles which bog down the plot line, an overabundance of bad communication between characters (to the point where I almost put the book down because they were annoying me so much with their ridiculousness), and ludicrous turn-arounds from several of the side characters who suddenly start behaving supportive without any explained motivation. That being said; I did adore Lord Nathan and the end of his story was immensely satisfying. I just wish that Lady Iona and her family hadn't been so ridiculously eye-roll worthy.",2,0
"This was my least favorite book in the series. Very disappointed since the entire series has been getting better and better until this really boring story. This story lacks chemistry, characters that hold your interest and basic common sense. The first 99 out of 100 pages the heroine does not trust the hero of the story, then all the sudden on the last page she forgives him entirely and everything is perfect. In the end everyone was forgave each other but I was still mad at her and still hated  him. To everyone out there, read every other book in this series but this one, and let's just hope the next one is a lot better.",2,0

"Okay so all of the reviews for this are good, really good. that's why i bought the book. I normally dont like the BDMS thing, but when they are good they tend to be great. I did not feel this way about this book. The author takes the Dom/sub relationship way too far in this book, going into ""slave"" stuff. yuck yuck yuck.So basic plot line. Abused girl flees from an abusive jerk of a boyfriend, one who beats the crap out of her. She runs to the only safe place that she has ever known, her uncle's boat, only to discover two men living in a BDMS life and they have bought her uncle's boat. One man is an ex-cop, Sully. Clarisse doesn't trust him because he is a cop and the ""master"" in the relationship. and the other man, Mac, is the submissive. This is where I start to really dislike the book. Most of the BDMS books that I have read both men are productive in some kind of fulfilling life career. Not Mac. The whole ""slave"" thing really comes into play. All Mac does is clean the house and have sex. that's it. The men bring Clarisse into their home so that she can recover, saying that she doesnt have to participate. What??? If i was invited to someone's house after having the crap kicked out of me by a boyfriend and agreed why would you tell someone about your sex life. That would make me run in the opposite direction not toward it. it was really weird. Then as she grows to love the men, the men grow fond of her. Mac tells Sully he love Clarisse but will never leave Sully for her. Sully doesnt really admit his feelings at this time.It is kind of like Mac wants a pet of his own. So Mac tells Clarisse he loves her, but it is not really a full love because he belongs to Sully and will only ever belong to him. Sully will be the one to marry her but she is not at the same rank as Mac and if it came down to a choice Mac would win. I was more then frustrated. The men want her but I never really felt like they loved her. She really struggles with the D/s thing. I felt as though the men never really cared. They want to convince Clarisse that Dom/sub life is more then it seems but if she cant except it take a hike. But when she cant they want her to stay. To say I was confused is an understatement. So Clarisse is invited to several D/s parties, she grows to understand and except the lifestyle they are in. But she still doesn't belong to the men fully. Sully says no sex until they are married. But the weird thing is Sully and Mac did it all the time before they were truly committed with one another. Clarisse agrees to marry Sully, for the life of me i dont understand. He had not said he loved her at this point in the book. She just doesnt want to be alone, away from Mac. But Mac only kind of loves her. stupid.So after all the conflict and drama in the book's surrounding plot line (with the exboyfriend) she marries Sully. She wears both his and Mac's rings on her finger. Sully wears Mac's ring and Mac wears Sully's ring. The author makes a point to tell you this because even though Clarisse loves both men both men only really claim eachother.SO after saying all of that... I was down right annoyed with this book. YUCK!!! BDMS can be good. But when you dont have an equal relationship between the partners it is crap. I really wanted Clarisse to heal and then move out of their house. Mac for the most part only calls Sully ""master"" and then when she gets sucked into their lifestyle she does the same. Sully is the only one working and making money. Clarisse is the thirdwheel in this relationship. I hated that.I have read other books by Tymber Dalton/Macy Largo and they have been good. Sunset Hearts for example is wonderful.My advice dont waste your money.",1,0
"Plot/Storyline: 5 StarsThis is the best Markhat ""story"" I have read so far. I put ""story"" in quotes because, although it's that way in the title, this is actually a novel.The plot was original with a gritty, noir setting. The fantasy world of Markhat was enthralling. Mr. Tuttle really knows how to draw the reader into a different world by showing the way things are, instead of just telling about it.The storyline moved at a fairly fast pace. There were some twists and turns that left me gasping, once even bringing a few tears. Although the book is filled with Vampires and other odd creatures, it is still a very `human' story.Although this book is part of a series featuring the character of Markhat, like the others, it can be read as a stand-alone.Character Development: 5 StarsMarkhat was a wonderfully deep character with an interesting past that was revealed in bits and pieces throughout the story. He was always `in character' with believable motivations.Mama Hog was also present in this installment. I was happy to see her again as she is the perfect companion and mother-figure for Markhat.The new characters introduced in this book were also very well-drawn. Each had their own motives and personalities, making them likable or easy to hate, as needed.Writing Style: 5 StarsMr. Tuttle was in his usual fine form. There was humor interlaced through even the most gruesome portions. The humor was sometimes blatant and, at other times, a bit obscure, but always there if a reader cared to look, and I did.The descriptions were vivid. The dialogue was snappy and in good form. Everyone spoke with just the right amount of accent to be believable and have a unique voice. The sentence structure was complex, but flowed easily.Editing/Formatting: 5 StarsBoth were of professional quality.Rating: PG-13 for Blood and Gore, Oblique References to Prostitution, Violence",5,1

"The year is 2070 and the Earth has turned inwards after a plague outbreak that has left people wary of traveling to other countries let alone into outer space. When a bumbling alien who isn't legally allowed to visit the Earth accidentally gives a university student plans for small portable cold fusion units along with a field that can nullify gravity, the student and the planet find themselves thrust into Galactic trading, ready or not.If this plot appeals to you, you will get your .99 worth out of this book. But before you click ""buy"" understand that plot is all you will get. The characters are tissue paper thin, and the writing is some of the worst I've ever read. Yet, read it I did because the plot was so darn engaging.There are numerous typos, a severe lack of editing (there's even one page where an entire paragraph is repeated), and a lot of truly awkward prose. It's almost as if the book were written in one sitting as a 'stream of consciousness' first draft and then never polished before being published.You won't believe how awkward it is at places unless I give you some examples so here's two choice quotes;1. ""The ship began took on its finished shape...""2. ""The reality turned out to be a bit different as there was little 'control' but many inherited problems. The World Government was incompetent, as most government are incompetent, but the oversight actually provided competency where there was little to none before. The reality of a distant, weak, slightly incompetent government actually worked. It didn't work everywhere because culture and corruption was so endemic but that is reality.""Say what? Honestly, I can't believe that I didn't quit reading after I got to that last example. But that plot! Man, I found the plot engaging.I'm convinced that if the author would pony up for a proper editor, he might have a hit on his hands something along the lines of theSolar Clipper Trader Tales, but as it stands I'd be embarrassed to recommend this book to a friend because as much as I enjoyed reading it, it really is a nothing more than a first draft.Disclosure: I received a free review copy of this book.",2,0

"It's Docia and Cal's wedding as the back drop for Pete and Janie's romance.  All the 'Wedding From Hell' drama you'd expect plus it's still full of characters you love to love or love to hate.  Plus there are nice plot twists to keep you guessing, a few anxious moments that don't last too long and overall, a fun read.I'll give Benjamin props for creating more than once, a female villain that I just loved to hate (as in the first book).  Granted, while I wanted her flattened by a meteor or slapped silly in an ""Airplane"" like line-up by most of the characters, but her comuppence was adequate.Five stars, highly recommended with more of the same fun, quirky characters, cute pets, over the top small town Texas that makes these books a pure joy to read.",5,1
"I loved this story.  Indeed, once I started it, I didn't want to put it down.  It was a charming, romantic retelling of the Beauty and The Beast story set in Regency England.  Louisa, an heiress, was an ugly duckling who wanted someone to care for her, not her fortune.  Her parents had passed and she was living with her grandfather who wanted her to be married.  Douglas, a vampire with a conscience, was a loner in the extreme.  He was living in a cave with no interaction with others besides what he physically needed to survive. He had his own inner demons to fight as he was guilt-ridden from an incident early in his life.  The day Louisa stumbled upon Douglas' cave was a life-changing event for both of them.  Karen skillfully used their interplay of words to develop their relationship.  There were a few other characters and scenes interspersed in the story but most of the story took place in the cave.  I enjoyed this book very much.  I was very happy with the ending and actually came away from the book feeling as if I'd learned a valuable lesson from it.  Bottomline:  This is a feel good book that I'd highly recommend to anyone who loves romance and/or adult fairy tales.",5,1
"I read the entire ""book"" which is the only reason I didn't give it one star.  Apparently this prequel to other Rachel Vincent books in this same genre is supposed to explain some of the backstory and entice the reader to want to read more.  If so, it does a terrible job because nothing is really explained and I had zero desire to read any further in this storyline.I disliked the teen girl protagonist's attitude throughout the short book, although I think she was a reasonably accurate picture of the extreme egocentricity, wild mood swings, annoying sarcasm, and lack of rational thought exhibited by many teenagers today.  I'm the father of two female teens so I've got quite a bit of experience with them.  She may have been accurately portrayed but she wasn't sympathetically portrayed and as a result I could not care less what happened to her.",2,0

"~* 1.5 Stars *~Yoga instructor and business owner Kerri Harris and divorce attorney Mitch MacAuley have been best friends for years. Only friends. But when Kerri and Mitch are out one night sharing a friendly drink, she tells him she wants to marry and asks Mitch to introduce her to some single, eligible men. There's nothing Mitch wouldn't do for Kerri, but her request bothers him. A lot.As she starts to date the guys he reluctantly introduces her to, he gets more and more uncomfortable and tension rises in their friendship. Soon the friendly quips between them that used to be teasing fun take on more bite and a decade long friendship goes from smooth to rocky. Tensions and tempers rise between them. Pushed to the brink, a fight between them ends in a kiss - a wild, tempestuous kiss that changes everything...but solves nothing. Can two friends accept the fact that they're made for each other or will the differences between them kill their friendship and destroy the chance for love?Despite the fact that the friends-turned-lovers theme is one of my favorites in contemporary romance, I had way too many problems with this book to be charmed. The plot was two dimensional and predictable, the narrative lacked sophistication, the dialogue lacked conversational flow, and the characters lacked charm.The characters were the biggest problem. More specifically, Kerri. Mitch had little to recommend him as a romantic lead, but he wasn't overly objectionable, despite an unhealthy anger management issue or two. Kerri, on the other hand, I found to be utterly contemptible. She blames Mitch for everything that goes wrong in their relationship, takes no responsibility for her own actions or feelings on any matter, flits between wildly contradictory emotions at a blink, is pathologically immature, and is grievously self involved. I may not have warmed up to Mitch, but I actively disliked Kerri.The romance started to improve towards the end, but ended up floundering when the dialogue took a turn for the worse. Two comments in particular stick in my mind, at the turning point for the relationship between Mitch and Kerri, Mitch says the following:""I want to be with you, and most of all, I don't want anyone else to be with you.You think you need a husband? Fine, then - it's going to be me.""You want kids and I want them to be mine. Nobody else's.""Neither one of those comments come anywhere near my idea of romance, nor do they inspire a lot of confidence in the relationship. Mitch comes off seeming less interested in being with Kerri because he loves her and more interested in making sure that she's not with anyone else. Admittedly, these comments are taken out of context, but they provide examples of the problems I had with the dialogue.On the positive side, Jamieson writes very sensual, erotic sex scenes. The naked yoga in particular was a sultry, seductive delight, and as a whole the sex was very well done and provided the best written scenes in the book. The rest, unfortunately, didn't work for me.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",2,0
"Although the beginning of a Kate Lawrence novel typically start off slow (just a tad bit too much mundane detail about nothing) this was a pretty good novel.  My only gripe with a KL mystery is the often too tidy ""solve"" of the mystery- it's like the motive is always half assed and silly.",3,1

"I've had Parallax by Jon Merz on my Kindle for several weeks. Finally, I found some reading time, and what a treat this mob hitman novel was. I'll admit right now that I'm not a big fan of hitman novels, but the character of hitman Frank Jolino was so finely drawn that I was hooked within the first few pages.I'd love to see Jolino in other books because he was intelligent, articulate, droll, and at ease in his own skin. He also surprised me because he had a moral compass. Add all that to the fact that he was a vintage mystery reader, and you get a guy who is complex, appealing, and likable. Oh, yeah, he kills people for a living, but they're by no means innocents undeserving of being whacked, but Merz lets the reader draw that conclusion. He doesn't state the obvious and then hammer it home.Less likable is Ernst Stahl, once an idealist radical and now a jaded assassin, despite constant reminders from Stahl's character that he was completing a job only to save his son. His moral compass is stuck on ""anything goes in the name of paternal love.""When the two end up in some odd paranormal mutual awareness of each other, it's interesting albeit rather unbelievable, but the compelling character of Frank Jolino keeps the reader turning the pages. You probably won't suspend disbelief, but you'll be compelled to keep reading. You'll also be rooting for Frank to figure a way out of the mess and to, somehow, end up with the babe who has some surprises of her own.WarningI downloaded the book in February, and there are numerous ""glitches"" in the book. I won't call them typos because, since I publish ebooks, I know that they are conversion errors that occur when punctuation marks in a Word manuscript get changed to weird symbols when the manuscript is converted to different file formats like HTML which Kindle uses for their digital publishing. Don't let this deter you from enjoying the book.I advise you to ignore the Product Description because it's a spoiler of what are meant to be neat plot twists. Just buy the book.

I will look for future works, to see if he has changed his style, inside the box.",3,1
"Prequel to the series, this is more short story than anything else. Funny how you can find a sweet story amid fire & brimstone.This does NOT need to be read in any order and stands on its own quite nicely. This is something of the set up for the rest of the books. In fact, you will probably enjoy it more if you already HAVE read some of the other books.The writing is thick with imagery and sensuality- as is Ms. Showalter's trademark. Don't look for depth- just desperation and passion. It is more of an experience than a story. It wraps around you like a smooth glass of port.In case you are not familiar with the series, you should know that this novella is actually a bit of a departure from the style of the rest of the books. This is one of my favorite series- hot, sensual, dark & dangerous. This story is more of an aside, like a fable within the Lords of the Underworld universe.",4,1

"Jolene Benate was devastated when her husband died leaving her a widow at the age of twenty.  That had been six long years ago.  Rather than wallow in self pity, Jo used his life insurance to attend a special training program for women interested in law enforcement.  She's made a name for herself and is now in one of the highly sought after positions on the elite warrant squad. The only area of her life where she hasn't moved on is her love life.  Since her husband's death, not once has Jo taken a lover even though she's had plenty of opportunities.As a member of the elite warrant squad Jo's used to facing down bad guys and plenty of injuries but the recent attacks against her are troubling.  Sure the protection team will do their best to protect her but even they are no match for the men who are after her.  Jo realizes that she's pissed off her share of perpetrators but even she's stumped as to who's after her and why.Paul Benate believed that he was doing the right thing when he allowed Jo to believe he'd died.  His position dealing with extremely classified projects makes him a target so he's had to live within the confines of a small base which is extremely difficult to penetrate.  When he learns of the attacks on Jo, he realizes that his sorry attempt at protecting her by letting her go has failed miserably.  The only option acceptable to him is having her brought to him.  The old Jo would have been ecstatic to learn that her husband still lives: the new Jo is beyond furious that Paul allowed her to be deceived for so many years.Jo's worked long hard hours to gain the respect of her team and make a life for herself - without Paul.  So him thinking that he has the right to have her kidnapped and brought to him is simply too much.  She may still love Paul but no way is she going to allow him to dictate her life.Mary Wine tells an amazing tale with STILL MINE!  I loved Jo's kick butt attitude and yet she still has this vulnerability that endears her to readers.  She's a feisty little woman and even Paul is stunned by the changes that have taken place with her over the past six years.  Paul is very much in love with Jo so even though she's furious with him, as a reader I couldn't help but want them to have their happily ever after.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",5,1

"I enjoyed this one very much, great story and a surprising twist.  The love scenes are always amazing hot. I would like to see the mother get her come-uppance in a sequel.",4,1
Well-written and fast-paced.  This is a second chance romance set in the UK and the author did a good job inserting scenes from the past into the present.  I like both leads.  I can understand how the pregnancy loss broke up their young marriage.  The past misunderstanding is also handled fairly well.I would have preferred more angst in their renewed relationship though.  Their reason for having sex is not very believable.  It would have been better for them to just get carried away with each other.Some reviews here complain about the lingo but I did not find the medical bits distracting at all.  The professional lives of these characters define them and give the story a strong sense of place.  This book was a freebie but I definitely would have paid for it.,4,1

"I've read some erotic stories, and I believe this is a well written one, since it does not go overboard like some do. It keeps you reading, wanting to know what's going to happen next, which is always good. The reason why I give 4 stars to this one is that there was something I did not like very much and it is the characters' stereotypes; we have Antonio who is latin, trigue&ntilde;o (or with burned skin), muscular, (you get the picture); and then Jane, who is blond, curvy, and all the descriptions one might think of--like a said: stereotypical. But other than that, is a good story.",4,1

"Roane by Marie HarteI liked it.  This is a new series for me reminiscent of the Breed series by Lora Leigh and Laurann Dohner's New Species series but with a slightly different spin.

"What the blurb doesn't tell you is that the main character is a divorced 40+ woman/cougar looking for a quick one night stand with a younger man. No talk, no feelings she just wanted a nice night. The man happens to be a werewolves. After she finds out, she doesn't want anything to do with him anymore. If you don't mind reading about a 40+ that has been married for over 20 years. Than this is your book :)",3,1
"Aislinn is only seven years old when her brother is killed. To uphold the family honor, Aislinn is determined to become a knight in his place. With the blessing of the king and the approval of her father, she begins her training. She makes a few friends and endures some minor bullying, but she does manage to do well in her lessons.I enjoyed Aislinn&#8217;s early years as she struggled to learn and catch up to the other students. She has a determined personality, and she does not give up or give in to self pity. She doesn&#8217;t make excuses for herself, she simply tries harder. I feel she sets a wonderful example for all young girls. She proves that you can do anything you want, no matter the opposition.This is a good story at heart, and it has some memorable characters. It was presented to me as fantasy, but it is lacking in that department. There is some minor magic which appears about two-thirds of the way through, and I would have liked to have had that throughout the story. Perhaps it is more prevalent in future installments of the series. Aislinn does have visions to communicate with her deceased brother, which introduces a paranormal aspect. For me, this story falls more under historical fiction than fantasy. Romance came into play at the end, and it was nice to see a man who preferred a strong woman over a typical obedient wife.I was quite surprised to see her riding out after bandits at the young age of 9-10. That seems far too young, even for the boys who are training alongside her. I doubt any child would be required to do such a thing until they were closer to 14-15 years old, even in 1155 CE. A typical girl of her era would have been too small to go around slashing at bandits.There are a few wrong word errors in this book, and it could benefit from a professional proofreader. I doubt her brother was killed by a &#8220;rouge band of bandits&#8221; (unless they were all wearing red). I suspect the author intended to use the word &#8220;rogue&#8221;. We all make mistakes, but some typos can change the meaning of a sentence and convey the wrong message to a reader. I found the high number of errors to be distracting.I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",3,1

I read one other slave narrative and enjoyed it. During the depression the government sent writers out to interview former slaves so we would not forget. I enjoyed it and finished the book. Interesting to read about slavery from former slaves/ There was not one person who claimed any abuse from former owners in this book.,2,0
"Since I mostly listened rather than read the book, I have no complaint to make about the editing. Beyond that, however, was the absence of any sense of reality with regard to characters and situations. Without revealing specific situations to the person who will read the book, things happen which cannot possibly be the behavior of  Good Guys, other acts cannot be believed of any police force anywhere in the United States, and, the Bad Guys are caricatures with little credibility.Missed most is the absence of any depth in the characters. None are convincing as feature or even walk-on real people. Only two subordinate players are given any degree of life.The action itself is a confused mish-mash of tech-talk and violence with the Good Guys equipped with with super-gadgetry and the Bad Guys stand-ins from old Keystone Cops routines.No doubt it will please some who, in this instance, are prepared to be generous.",2,0

"These four books are some of Crusie's earlier books so they are shorter than most of her newer novels and the plotlines are not quite as well developed but her trademark humor and loveable characters are present in spades! These books are all great summer reads and at $10 for the set this is a steal!I think ""Getting Rid of Bradley"" is by far the best of the four followed by ""Strange Bedpersons"" and ""Charlie All Night"". ""What the Lady Wants"" is the weakest of the four in my opinion but it is still very readable.Enjoy!",5,1

"Miss Firecracker is the love story of Blake West and Willow, the former Miss Firecracker.  The book begins the morning after Willow's wild night of celebrating the end of her year as Miss Firecracker, a restrictive beauty pageant title that prevented her from dating or other ""wild"" behavior.  Willow did some damage to the bar the night before, and rather than arrest her, or let her pay for it out of her pocket, the sheriff decided she must waitress at the bar, using her tip money to pay for the damages.  Blake West is visiting from out of town, and managing the bar for the owner that is on vacation.  The sparks fly between Blake and Willow from the very start of the book.  Blake sees Willow as a sexy, strong, woman and is not uncomfortable with her position as foreman for the town's construction company, unlike most of the men in town.  Blake is far away from the West/McKay part of Wyoming, so Willow knows nothing about his ""wild McKay cousins.""  Their love story goes quickly, with the conflict and resolution occurring in less than one week.This was a quick read, lasting only a couple hours.  I thought this was a fun read.  However, when comparing it to the Rough Riders books by Ms. James, the love story wasn't nearly as consuming and addictive, I think because it is told so quickly.  This could be read as a standalone, but I think the story is richer if read in the context of knowing about the McKay cousins (who star in the Rough Riders books).  In the Rough Riders books, the McKays all have roles and plots in the story line.  In this book, since Blake is in a distant town, he only mentions the McKay cousins, but you don't actually meet them.If you want some back story on Blake, I would advise reading Rough Riders book number 6, Branded as Trouble before reading Miss Firecracker.  Unlike many reviewers, I believe the Rough Riders books can be read out of sequence, because that was what I did.  I read one of the later books, fell in love with the McKay/West family and the Rough Riders series, and have since read most of the Rough Riders books.  There is another West boy story, Mistress Christmas that occurs chronologically before Miss Firecracker.  I read the West boy books out of sequence, and feel that it is fine to read Miss Firecracker without reading Mistress Christmas. Though, Mistress Christmas is so good, I think you'd enjoy reading that one.  If you would like both stories in a paper format, check out the bookWild West Boys, it contains Mistress Christmas and Miss Firecracker. I've read most of the books about the McKay/West family, so if you're curious you can read more about them in my other reviews.",4,1
"I'm unfamiliar with this author, and I was really surprised at the depth she put into this short story. Right from the beginning, I could see how well-put together this story is, lots of descriptive detail, dynamic character and easy dialogue. I love short stories, and it's not that easy to take short fiction and pack it with substance and intrigue. This story is short but layered; there's some darkness to it, some magic and fantasy, and some seduction and scheming.The story is told in first-person from the POV of Sir Dardanus, but what makes that unique for me is that he's really an anti-hero, ""a bastard and ne'er-do-well, a murderer and a seducer of women."" Just what won't this man do in order to get what he desires? Even at the end, I was still a bit uncertain about what he'd actually do, and with the way the author left the final page, I have to wonder how or if this romance will continue. I choose to see hope and promise there, mixed with the darkness.This isn't a sweet, happy romance, Dardanus and his intentions a little too dark and moody for that. Also, I wouldn't say that this story is overly erotic (and I do think it needed to be more erotic in that detail), but certain aspects of the story do hold some sex appeal for me: the domination and surrender, the dark and complex hero, even the slightly rough sex scene and the tension behind it. Combined with the author's skill, all of those things produce an engaging short read and a hero who knows how to leave his mark. I want more of him.The Knife's Edge ends at location 366; the rest of the download is excerpts fromThe Fever and the FuryandPoisoned Kisses: Poisoned Kisses\Midnight Medusa (Harlequin Nocturne).",4,1
"I hate, I mean absolutely hate to give this two stars. But I just can't give it more stars because I would want the same warning before I buy an awful book. I can't remember how much I paid for this, but even 99 cents is too much. Honestly I want to give it one star, but I'm trying to find the good in it.Before I list pros and cons, I must mention that this is a Christian book. But other than a few prayers and mentioning once that they were in church, it's not drenched in it. There's no preaching, and in fact I wouldn't think a non-Christian would have a problem with this book (other than the negatives I list below...) But on that same note- if you're looking for something kinda conservative or like Jenny B Jones (whom I would highly recommend) - this is not really it. It's kind of watered down Christianity. And I'm not saying that's bad- that may make you want to buy this book more. :)The positives: There's a good story in here. Many girls have done what the lead character, Kate,  does.... gives her heart to a boy who doesn't return the same feelings. And there's another love story that ends in a guy that's just ""Not that into her."" So many readers should be able to relate to one of her stories.There are even a couple funny lines in there where i laughed out a little bit.Kate had some witty lines and has a pretty strong character to her.And, aside from what I will write as my 1st point in the negatives list, the story does get better. The 2nd half almost (but not quite) redeems the first part.The negatives: I truly hate to say this but that may be one of the worst written books I've ever read. Oh how badly I wanted to stop reading after chapter 1.It would have stuff like: "" 'I'm so mad' said Kate angrily.""  Every single time someone spoke it had a ""Said so and so"" after it. There's an art to writing and that ain't it. ;-)I'm wondering if this is the author's first book. And I'm guessing it didn't have an editor.***************BIG FAT SPOILER*************I did not like that ending!!! Are you kidding me? We get to know two other guys that she falls in love with but not the guy she actually marries???????????? They say like 7 sentences to each other and then get married?????? I hate that the author left this stuff out. This is what we want to read. We want to see the dialog between them so we can see they belong together. There wasn't enough there for me to feel as though Kate had feelings for him, or knew anything about him other than his one tragic loss.It was the most important relationship in the entire book, summed up in about 6 pages, and left me disappointed and wanted more . Not more of their lives to follow, but more of the meat of their relationship to help me realize they were good together. I just didn't get it.What a shame.",2,0

"One thing you could say of T.A. Chase's books is that they are all very different. This one is a sexual romp (from Merriam Webster Online romp = a: high-spirited, carefree, and boisterous play b: something suggestive of such play: as (1): a light fast-paced narrative, dramatic, or musical work usually in a comic mood (2): an episode of lovemaking).Kasey is a 23 years old pro basketball player. He is only in his second year as professional player and he has no courage to openly admit that he is gay. He is out with his family and friends, but not with the public opinion. Plus his twin brother Garrett, a famous actor, has made coming out some years ago and now all media are only waiting for him to make the same claim.But Kasey till now has never had a boyfriend to care and he doesn't see the reason to suffer all the harrassment he will receive in the locker room if he makes that claim. That is, but now in Kasey's life enters Gram, a night club owner and an openly gay man who had bad experiences in the past with closeted lovers.Kasey must decide if he is willing to risk his career to keep his lover by his side.The story is not very long, less than 90 pages, but it's very erotic. From the first time Kasey and Gram have a very intense relationship and they are driven by lust most of the time. Since Kasey is a 23 years old guy that for sometime was deprived of a sexual partner, I think it's not strange that now that he can have someone near him, he is in frenzy to make up for the lost time. Plus it was a true discovery that Kasey is a totally bottom. I'm used to sports characters to be always very manly, even if gay, and usually they are totally top. Instead Kasey wants to be mastered, even if he is a pushy bottom.The main characters don't interact a lot with the supporting characters, but there are some interesting figures: Garrett, Kasey's brother, Paul, Kasey's teammate, but also Bo, Gram's employee and Colville, another pro basketball player. Since this is the first book in a series, I think we will have the chance to read something on one or plus of these characters.",5,1

Charlie is delighted because he has always loved her, Alex is delighted too because he feels the same way about her. Now Allie and Alex have to convince Charlie that the three of them belong together. I really enjoyed this book.

"I met Dan and Elle in Dirty, Megan Hart's first Harlequin Spice release. I loved that book.I won't rehash the storyline because the blurb does that amazingly well. What I will tell you is that I absolutely LOVED this book. It's rare to find an author who can write as poignantly as Megan Hart, what's even rarer is finding an author who can write short stories that are just as deep, touching, and moving. This story was more than I imagined it to be. I thought, ""A short story about Elle and Dan! Yay!"" I read the blurb and expected Elle to be at war with her feelings regarding a baby (which she was). What I didn't expect was so much to be packed into so few words. It was about Elle but we also got to see so many other people in her life and what they mean to her and how they help her form her decision as to whether or not she's ready to have a baby. In the end, the decision she makes comes from her heart. I love how well Dan fits her. He just lets her make her own decisions. He may plant the seed of thought there, but he doesn't push. THAT is what makes them perfect together.I love follow-up stories like this. Thank goodness for Spice Briefs because otherwise we may not have had another chance to visit with Dan and Elle. I can't help but wonder if Ms. Hart will, at some time in the future, let us drop in on Elle and Dan and see what's new in their lives once again. I know they've got their happily-ever-after and that alone can sustain me, but I like Elle and her complexity. She's real. Megan Hart has quickly become on of my favorite authors.",5,1
"Every book I read and love resonates with me. As I'm sure it does for others who enjoy a good book. This one, as I read it, made me think of my relationship with my husband and the power of a transcendent love.Summary: The sight of the red door saves Colin Baxter in his dream, but very quickly a man appears and the dream becomes a thing of raw sexual need with a person Colin can't identify. He just knows the man needs him, and Colin aches to find and heal his lover...even if the man doesn't really exist.Marek Donovan just wants to be left alone to lick his wounds and recover from a terrible loss. The rundown house in Fiji suits his minimal needs just fine. He doesn't want to face the world again, and on a small, secluded island figures he's safe from everyone and everything. Particularly guilt from his past.Dreams of this nameless man and his house plague Colin for two years, but he's come to care about his phantom lover so deeply he doesn't want them to end. Then Colin visits Fiji and comes face-to-face with the house from his visions, prompting him to believe these dreams just might be his destiny.Colin knocks on the door, determined to find answers.What I liked about this book: This is one of the Cameron Dane books that is not just smoking hot but grips your heart, clenches it in a tight fist and doesn't let go from start to finish! I have to admit that I had a harder time reading this one than the other books because it deals with such a huge loss and the pain that guilt from losing someone you love because of your own pride causes and I was not prepared emotionally to delve into that quagmire.But Marek and Colin kept drawing me to their story and with every step into their budding and troubled relationship, I fell deeper into the hope of their ""happily ever after"". Cameron Dane has that wonderful ability to not just make the characters come to life, but their raw emotions slam into you with such fierceness, you find yourself gasping and verbally outing yourself while reading her books in public.",4,1

"I really love the fine leather cases that are available for the kindle and which come in so many beautiful colors. However, I can't justify the cost--even if buying it with a gift certificate. Still, I needed a case to protect the kindle and this one fits the bill almost perfectly. It's soft but sturdy and well-made with good and smooth zippers and should last a long time.My only complaint is that, since it's black it blends in with everything and is hard to spot sometimes on a desk (with so many other black things), in the car, in the purse, in the computer bag. I'm going to have to do something to make it stand out. I wish that there were other color options for it. Of course, I knew it was black going in, so I have no cause to complain.

"Serial is a short story that tells a thrilling tale of what happens when two serial killers meet unknowingly.  One of the serial killers is a man, appearing to be elderly and harmless, who preys on innocent hitchhikers; the other is an innocent-looking young girl who plays the role of a hitchhiker, killing whoever picks her up.  The first two short chapters deal with introducing these serial killers and their very gory habits in murder.  The third and final short chapter has them meet up and finish quite an interesting story.  Now, know that this is a quick read, (you'll probably finish it in under 30 minutes) but it is still very entertaining, assuming that you don't mind graphic violence and murder.  The killing in the story is vivid without being overly explicit; to be honest, I found it to be pretty hardcore, but some readers may find it to be rather tame if they are used to extremely explicit stories.  Obviously, the development is amazing because of the fact that this is a short story, but overall, I think the authors did very well in writing this story.  Overall, this is a violent tale but also a chilling one that tells a very unique and interesting story.  I really enjoyed it, and I think fans of serial killer books will enjoy it, too.NOTE - In addition to the story in this ebook (which really only takes up about 2/3 of the ebook) there is an included interview with the two authors interviewing each other and two excerpts from books that they each wrote solo.Warnings - Mild Language, Sexual Insinuations, Very Graphic Violence",4,1
"This little 65 page novella is the first of two novellas by this Author. Readers of a sensitive nature need to be aware that this short story deals with the topic of assisted suicide and contains profanity and some sex.This novella is a very well researched and altogether thought-provoking commentary on end of life issues, euthanasia, and the uncertainties inherent in research on the brain and death. It touches on issues that many readers, may or may not have had personal experience of particularly in this day and age where people are able to be kept alive long after they should've been let go, by medical research and already in situ practices.The characters are developed extremely well, with the male lead adding heavily to the overall success of this little read. If the energies the Author had put into developing the characters been directed elsewhere, not only would they have become two-dimensional and uninteresting it would have affected the plot as a whole. The characters different points of view and thoughts on the topic covered are well researched and make this short story seem as if it is a full length book.There were two things that bothered me though about this novella; one was the relationships formed between the male lead and the two diametrically opposite females, but then again who can fully explains the laws of attraction and there is the old saying `there are two types of women, those you take home to Mum, and those you don't', which put to rest any damage these relationships may have done to my enjoyment of this read. Another niggle were the proofreading errors, which normally really spoil a read for me; in this case that was not to be. Yes, there were typos, but they were so easily discerned and non-intrusive that it did nothing to detract from the overall enjoyment of the short.The book finishes with a lot of loose ends, rather like life actually and, although I was initially surprised by the very abrupt ending, I decided that not only did it work well but suited the book, and what there is of the book has stayed with me for a long time after I finished reading.I would recommend this to book to anyone who would like a good quick read that will make them think. However, because of its subject matter I would probably aim for the YA reader upwards.Originally reviewed on:  [...]",4,1
"This author is talented, but needs quite a bit of polishing. I agree with other reviewers that the English words and phrases are quite distracting for a police procedural set in Los Angeles. Otherwise, the story started out pretty well but soon became somewhat difficult to follow; as the story progressed, it became more and more implausible. The ending was so abrupt as to be very surprising.  It just stopped leaving the reader to wonder if the publisher had omitted a couple of chapters. Character development of the principals was barely satisfactory, and the others were just cardboard characters at best. As the story moved to its climax, it seemed that the author wanted to get it over with, and some really important developments to the story were dealt with summarily and without any real substance.  This of course led to greater implausibility. There were some misspelled words and the like along the way, so better editing and proofing would help in his next effort for which I wish him good luck.",2,0
"Sorry, just didn't grab me at all. It had the right ingredients, just didn't come together in a way that I could enjoy it. And I tried. Three times. This will be only the third book I have deleted from my library.",1,0
"The hero and heroine aren't that great, but the plot is excellent with a mystery to solve and a marriage to save. Emily is one of my least favorite character types - afraid of everything. Afraid to love her husband because he might break her heart again, afraid to attend any ""ton"" events because people will not accept her, etc... And worse, instead of telling her husband about her fears, she resorts to manipulation to solve her problems. On the plus side, she has a good heart and ALWAYS has the best interests of her loved ones in mind. Lord Whitmore is another of my least favorite characters types - selfish. He does warm up and evolves into a good husband and father to Emily's niece and nephew. And once he gets his priorities straight, he puts in the effort to be a mind reader to figure out what will make Emily happy.Overall the book was an enjoyable read because the plot is very interesting. The H/h are both flawed but balanced with other good qualities and as the story develops they become more likable. The writing is excellent and well edited. There are multiple explicit scenes which can be skipped if that's an issue for you. I'd recommend this book if you're in the mood for a good mystery/romance.",4,1
"Enjoyed this version of wizards, witches and magic. I liked that the heroine had a mind of her own and spoke her peace. A good read.",4,1
"Was not real impressed to short of a story didn't have that, I can't put this down effect. Not what I was expecting",1,0
"This book is almost paranormal erotica. The plot is thin and unresolved, but the sex scenes are hot. Had the Euro wolf white slaver ring plot point actually been followed and tied up this book would have been really good. But the entire plot resolution took a dozen sentences at best. Not particularly satisfying for mystery and police procedural fans like me.I like a good shifter romance as long as they aren't saccharine bodice busters, but this book wasn't nearly as deeply written as this talented writer could have made it.",3,1
Too hard to get into the story...  Too many run-on sentences / thoughts...  I got bored with the character intros in the very 1st story and just deleted it off my Kindle.,2,0
"After reading the other reviews I purchased this title and was disappointed.  This isn't a different story and the characters were poorly developed.  The slaves at Cascade (and in this society), don't ""choose"" to be slaves in the sense that they have options.  Generally, in this society if you don't have a job or training you become a slave.  Alex, is an anomaly in that he one of the few who chooses slavery because of his specific sexual needs and he is older-47 years old.  He has a trade, makes a living but his submissive nature calls him to slavery.  His situation is very different than most of the other slaves we meet:  Noah, Jackson, and Gavin.  Gavin's experience as a slave led him to refuse to even consider owning a slave until Alex comes along.  And this is a huge problem in the continuity of the character development of Gavin.  Alex is the first slave he's trained who is actually choosing to become a slave when he has more attractive alternatives (from Gavin's point of view).  As a result, he's overprotective, holds back and goes ""easy"" on Alex while trying to convince him that slavery is the wrong choice for him.  None of this makes sense-why does Gavin choose to help out the one person who is looking forward to becoming a slave and would happily go with any of the men who take him for a test drive-the rougher the better.  One would think that he would have chosen, before this point,  to help out someone in dire straits-terrified, young, no options, but not Gavin he waits until someone comes to him who has options, is old enough to make a decision and indeed has thought about it and is only offering a 6 month contract so if this gig doesn't work out he can go back to his trade.  Very different than many of the other slaves we meet who have years of slavery to look forward to-again it would make more sense to help one of those people out.I did enjoy the relationship between Sam and Gavin, it was friendly and loving but given that they both had dominant natures I found it very odd, and hard to believe, that they didn't have a third in their relationship, someone very submissive to offset their dominance.  Sure, for the most part Sam let Gavin dominate him, but he wasn't really satisfied with that-as we see in the scene with Jackson when Demetri says ""how have you lived without this""?  I think, as readers, we're supposed to understand that this has been missing from Sam and Gavin's relationship and Alex's presence in their home would provide this. But again, that person did not have to be a slave. Alex would have been happy to go to Michael, Demetri even Brian and Rhys.  He wasn't looking for love, he wanted to be hurt and any of those men would have been happy to provide that.  I thought it was hilarious when they called Alex ""boy"" he was 47 years old for crying out loud!So the big conflict-Gavin not wanting to own a slave because he hated his time in slavery made no sense because Alex wanted to be a slave and Gavin worked as a fricking slave trainer, he had no problem, no conflict with his job.  And he was acting like an owner because he was totally ignoring Alex's desires.  Sam's arguments in favor of Alex making his own choices were good ones, but he was a fricking slave owner.  He only stopped owning slaves when he hooked up with Gavin-he had no problem using slaves whether or not they choose to be in the situation or not.  I felt like the author was trying to write Sam and Gavin as empathic and fair and totally missed the mark-they were poorly fleshed out and delusional.However, Alex was consistent and well developed.  The character of Demetri was fascinating.",2,0
"If you like your novels short and sexy, this book's for you. A racy romp that's a delightful read.The only quibble I have is that the publisher ran the author's bio right up against the last line of the story, so it was hard to tell where it ended. Hopefully the publisher will fix that by putting a few spaces in between.",5,1
The story is okay but the book has so many errors that halfway through it I started another book. I am not sure who did the proof-reading on this book but they did not do a very good job. It really messed with the flow of the story.,2,0

"Long ago a sorcerer cursed Kirill the Dragon with the affliction of impotence, something he refused to discuss with others of his kind.  Now, hope comes in the form of a Drui female mated to Xanthus, his heir.Shy and introverted Jazzlyn McCabe has gathered the courage to beg a favor from a lady she barely knows.  The owner of Inner Magick is Aislinn and she offered Jazzlyn help should she need it when they met at a gem mart months ago.Kirill has come to the world dominated by humans to find his mate who he glimpsed ages past in a mirror.  Jazzlyn asks Aislinn to help locate her missing cousin Caro, but what Jazzlyn gets is the man she saw in a mirror at Inner Magick.  It is time for Kirill to introduce Jazzlyn to true magic and her mate, him.Dragon Mate is the latest sensual treat in the Supernatural Bonds series by talented author Jory Strong.  This is a stand alone story but fans of the series will remember characters from earlier tales.  Dragon Mate is entertaining and sexy although Jazzlyn's responses don't always seem real.  For someone with no previous knowledge of magic she seems too easily accepting, taking it all in stride with barely a squawk or real appreciation. I've loved this series since the beginning and while Dragon Mate is definitely enjoyable there is just something that doesn't ring true with the heroine's reactions to the unimaginable.LisaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",4,1

"I picked this book up based on the earliest reviews - the first 6 reviews all gave it 5 stars!  The 1-3 star reviews that follow the initial gushing 5 star reviews are probably a bit more realistic.The premis of the story is quite good, but unfortunately the characters can't pull it off.  The good guy is one dimensional and, whilst there is plenty of back story...some might argue too much...there wasn't enough personality to keep me engaged.  Same issues for the 'baddies'.  Unfortunately I found myself looking at the '% read' at the bottom of the kindle and thinking 'Oh, still 40% to go.'  I had my next book lined up and, but not wanting to just give up, which is a last resort (only done with 2 books since I got the kindle) I pushed on and tried to get into it.I give it 2 stars based on the story and the price and plus the fact that I considered stopping mid way through.  I'm glad I finished it, but wont be hunting for the next one in the series.",2,0
"I want to start by saying this is a great cover. Sexy man in heart underwear clearly highlighting his ""attributes"" I mean what's not to like right. So without even cracking the cover it's off to a very promising start. The story is well paced, engaging and carries you seamlessly to the very last page. The relationship and interaction between the main charcters is natural, realistic and gets nice and steamy without dragging on too long in any one spot. I do wonder if anything will come of Suzanne and Stan seeing as there was mention of them meeting to discuss business and it stood out to me that maybe there could be more there?? Another book perhaps ;) In the end Lacy's adventurous side will balance out Gabe's more reserved side and they'll find their HEA. This was my first time reading Tori Scott and I'm definitly looking forward to reading her other books, cuz if there anything like this one I won't be disappointed!",5,1

"This book reads like the work of a talented teenager. It lacks any evidence of writing belong a high school essay. Emotion on the part of the main character consists of getting upset stomaches. Chapter five seems to be a rewrite of a similar chapter in McKinley's 'The Blue Sword'. Perhaps the author will someday develop the ability to write at a professional level, but there is no evidence of it here. Others have complained of the editing. I see no issue with that in the version I downloaded. 99 cents may be two high a price to pay for this book.",1,0
"I found the warnings regarding sex, violence and (gasp!) Aussie spelling amusing.I found this short story less amusing. The point of view moves between characters to reveal a rather popular plot-twist in a more modern, urban setting. The different voices are very similar and only distinguishable by the names atop the chapters. I was rather disappointed.",2,0
"If you've never read contemporary crime fiction, this may indeed be a disturbing read.  But for the rest of us, the idea of a killer-for-hire -- even one who tortures -- is familiar enough that I felt like I was one step ahead of the author for the majority of this (very short) story.Be aware that this is just designed to sell other books in the series and doesn't really function as a stand-alone piece.",2,0

This story was very slow paced and did not flow very well.  It was also very revolting that for more than a third of the book Leah thought that James was her brother but that didn't stop her from almost making love with him.... twice. (That's just gross.)  Their relationship just didn't seem natural even after she found out they were not blood kin.,2,0

"Not sure what's going on with this series.  I was hoping for an improvement from the first book, expecting that the author was more-or-less catching his stride.  But this installment was a meandering series of seemingly random events with nearly zero plot development, and characters that really didn't go anywhere from the first book.I ask myself these three questions: What were the characters doing at the beginning of the book?  What were they doing at the end of the book?  Do I know more about what's going on than I did at the beginning, or was this just filler?  My answers were not promising.The main character himself is still an improbably young, impossibly over-skilled vengeance addict.A few deus ex-machina devices deliver the characters from certain doom on multiple occasions which make the story a little cartoon-buffoon-ish.I think the author here has a *lot* of potential.  I like the flow of the prose, and how I never hiccup over the words or phrasing as a reader.  I like the writing style, which is why I gave the second book a chance.  At some point in the future I may give this author another shot, but not in this series, as the benefit of my doubt has just run out.*** spoiler alert below ****** SPOILER ALERT BELOW ***- How is it that three people about to be beheaded can fight their captors, jump down from the execution stage and *run* to their horses under the cover of a distraction?  Did the jailers forget to cuff their legs?  Were the cuffs opened remotely and magically?- For big, bad war demons, they're *remarkably* incompetent.  In fact, they're not just remarkably incompetent, they're extremely conveniently incompetent.  I'd rather have the 'mage who can do anything, anywhere, at any time' pop in and levitate everybody in the city simultaneously than have the ""oh my gosh, the demons who wanted them dead showed up just in time to prevent any executions... and then let them get away!!!""- So the main character is seriously bad-a**... obviously must've seen pretty much everything already... because he's totally prepared for anything... but things get a little icky and he just goes flat out insane?- Why is the female lead (who I thought was a good character in the first book, but have reversed my opinion in this sequel) even giving a crap about this self-obsessed weirdo?",3,1
"This book was sweet, but not in an adorable sappy, love you kind of way.  This book had a meaning behind.

"For awhile I thought this was going to be something special, but I was wrong. Even after 500 years these lovers still can't get enough sex or go without seeing each  other and nothing and no one else matters unless they can be together. It's supposed to be 'love conquers all' but here sex masquerading as love conquers all. These two need no one but each other and when together it's always becomes sex. This writer once again has a theme or concept that she fails to develop. It could be erotica except that the writer introduces too much into the story that separates a couple who don't want to be parted. They had been a team in the past but could not be so in the present nor was there any evidence of  what changes occurred in the world to which she could adapt but he could not. With more information about what was going on in the world that required her return other than a promise, the reader could understand her mission and perhaps see one for him as well. We're not given anything to work with that is developed enough to make sense even in a fantasy world. The characters not only remain the same physically for 500 years but they don't grow in intelligence or understanding of each nor the world around them. It's about sex that is only fulfilling at the moment and must constantly be repeated without loss of any passion or perception that they are not alone and may be needed else where. The 'Elders' seem to be nothing more that mythical gods who can't be pleased for long. Forever is no time at all to these people and life has no meaning that the writer shares with the reader. Trite! Hackneyed  and devoid of substance.",2,0
"I got one book, for free from my libary (# 3) so at that time I did not even realize these were a series.  But I really enjoyed that one so I went back to start at the beginning with this book.  I don't think you have to read them in order, there is enough information that I did not feel lost reading them out of order.  I really liked the story of this first book, the characters were very endearing in my opinion. I hope this helps someone else enjoy a good series.",4,1

"Initially from the prologue this seems to be a science fiction story about alien invasion however that is really a clever ploy to set the scene where a mountain community is stranded and have to survive with only their own resources. Unlike most ""survival / stranded / desert island"" stories because of how this is set up civilisation for this mountain community is not destroyed so they have the resources that are there and do not have to build from scratch exactly. Initially the story is set in a teenagers' camp with no adults where a resourceful 13 year old becomes ""chief"" and leads the camp through a number of adversities. The story is simply written and the problems encountered are too easily overcome but all of the characters and locations are well described so that I can visualise them. Although there is some killing it is not too graphic. I thoroughly enjoyed the book even though there were little twists to the plot it all held together very well and perhaps because the problems were easily overcome it had a feel good factor that is rare these days.",4,1
Really a typical story.  Probably a three star only due to the characters.  Actually a bit boring.  Hope next book is better,3,1

The storyline of Belora's (Maiden Flight) mother, Adora finding love after she has been a widow for 10 years is wonderful particularly when the man she meets is also a widower who lost his family. The meddling of the dragons is cute and very astute.The only fault I found was the story of her lost twin daughters being told several times, yes, it did move the story forward but it could have been better condensed.The introduction of new characters was handled well and the enemy king and his plans was well thought out and a great plot twist.  Well done.... I'm on to the next book Ice Dragon - can't wait!",5,1

"I hate to say this, cause I know it will make me seem somewhat aged, but I do remember The Best Little Whore House in Texas coming out on video AND being allowed to watch it. My parents were obviously total freaks, for which I am extremely grateful because I LOVED it. Possibly because of the clip of the football boys dancing below. O-o It was cool beans. So, reading this book, which was very reminiscent of TBLWHIT crossed with Pretty Woman, made me a wee bit nostalgic.Hunger was enjoyable and just a little bit grubby. Declan is a hustler with heart, cute freckles and a passion for Killian. While I found some of their relationship a little hard to fathom, and occasionally needing a little more warmth, they were overall a sweet couple. I was also really was interested to see how the author handled the transition from being a prostitute to shacking up with his one true love. Not to mention the whole semi virginal thing. Luckily my suspension of disbelief leapt into action, so it was all ok. Phew! The pacing was quick and a lot was packed in for a shorter novel, with the potential to flesh out more of the secondary characters for a series. Cute and quick read.",3,1

"These stories (&#60;--- not really a story) are just too short to engage the reader.  I read three of the stories(?) before I realized I was wasting my time, and they were not going to get any better.The pattern seemed to be write something postive, then move 180 degrees with a sentence to two.

"I enjoyed the first half more than the second, and it generally works out better if it's the other way around.The hero and heroine are OK. There's a healthy cast of characters and beginning threads of secondary plotlines - this is the first in a series - but you don't get anything of any real depth. There is no chance to grow invested in the lead couple, to care if things work out for them. And once the regular sex starts (instead of just the anticipation of same), everything else just stops anyway.But even the sex lacks depth. The BDSM lifestyle isn't really explored in any way. You get the usual explanation of what draws the heroine, the relief of a woman with overwhelming responsibilities letting someone else have control. But you never get any insight into his impulses. In fact, except for the fact that he's doing the spanking, the hero doesn't come across as a dominant at all. It bugged me.However, it wasn't bad. And it was free. So, you decide.",3,1
"I wanted to love it.There are so many flaws with the book so let's address the most prominent ones:Length is an issue for me. Long winded but never really getting anywhere.YA romance with nothing to sink your teeth into. I'm not asking for naked, hot, sex scenes on each page but the tween romance has been done, is over and the t-shirt was eaten by the washing machine.Cover dishonest. Look at the cover and refer to my previous comment.1/3-1/2 of the book seemed unnecessary. There was so much fluff it made it impossible to engage and finish the book.Spelling, grammatical and punctuational errors very rarely cause me to pause and try to figure them out. I can read through and my brain will automatically put what should go there, but there were many times I had to stop, consider and think about what was correct in that sentence. It became a distraction.I thought about reading the next book in the series because I hate giving bad reviews, but in all honesty the thought of a root canal or bamboo shoots under my fingernails seems to be more appealing ideas instead.  I'm sorry. I really wanted to like it, but it just fell too short for me to enjoy 90% of it.",3,1

"A little too cutesy and not really a very good read. It was more like a series of one liners strung together by a bad stand up comedienne. OK, maybe I did giggle a little.

"First off, I'm a fan of well written erotica. This wasn't it. There was little story with ramped up sex scenes that didn't do it for me.This author is new to me so I won't question her talent.

"I was excited to see that this book was free on Kindle and was going to read through it and then promote it to my following... but I was sorely disappointed. It looks as if the company wanted to gain exposure by publishing a book of their own, only they did a really poor job. The information contained in this book often contradicted itself. Instead of clearly setting forth book marketing tips, it basically listed a slew of marketing information that can be found easily on the internet. Most authors who have researched book marketing online know that that information doesn't always match up; e.g., Don't give your book away for free - tell people where they can buy it... A few pages later: Don't underestimate the power of free...? So which is it?Some of the marketing tactics listed were for cheating the system to raise your rankings. I didn't care for that at all. They also recommended a book via author, however never mentioned the title of the book... I'm sure I could search the authors name, but unless he has only written one book, I won't really know what book they were recommending - not that I would read something recommended in this book anyway.Finally, I can't leave a review without mention the formatting of this book. With the way they formatted it, it was hard to follow. The paragraphs seemed to just run together, which only added to the confusion of the information contained.",1,0

It's not going to blow your mind or change the way you look at fantasy. It will entertain you though. And really that's all you can ask for. For the most part it's your standard sword and sorcery novel. I would compare it to a forgotten realms or dragonlance type book.,3,1

"Serial (which is currently only available for the Kindle) is a novella co-written by horror writers Jack Kilborn (a.k.a. J.A. Konrath) and Blake Crouch. The story grabs your attention immediately with a great first line: ""The hardest thing about killing a hitchhiker is finding one to pick up."" As that sentence and the book's title should suggest, the subject matter of the book is disturbing. It's definitely not for the faint of heart.The story is told in three parts. The first section, written by Kilborn, is about Donaldson, a serial killer who likes to pick up hitch hikers and do bad things to them. His latest conquest and Donaldson's subsequent disposal of his passenger's remains are described in lurid detail. In the second part of the book Blake Crouch tells the story of another serial killer, Lucy, who is arguably even sicker than Donaldson. I won't ruin the surprise by describing her modus operandi. The third part of the book was co-written by the two authors, who took turns contributing 100-odd-word snippets until the story was finished. But they did so blindly, without the benefit of having read one another's initial sections. (The authors describe the writing process in an interview section following the story.) The last segment reads like a macabre chess match as the two killers meet and, unaware of the other's nature and intentions, try to outmaneuver each other. The story hangs together very well, particularly given its mode of composition. And it ends fittingly, if not surprisingly. The story doesn't offer anything by way of character development, but it's a quick read and it certainly holds one's attention for the short time it takes to read it.-- Debra Hamel",3,1

"This was a great book.  Having grown up in Oklahoma, where most of my friends are Native American, or at least have partial Native heritage (myself included), I have heard and read many stories of how the tribes were treated, as well as how they lived.  I didn't get too many of the heroes though.  We've seen movies that villainize some of the chiefs,  I didn't get the full picture from those stories and didn't see that the natives weren't just sitting around thinking about ways to attack white settlements.  They just wanted to live, and they didn't want to be invaded; and they were frequently lied to.I enjoyed reading each story.  In some cases, a deal would be made with one white representative, and it was a genuine deal in good faith, but later, some other politician (or general) would just decide to change the deal for their own benefit.  It was good to read that the villains weren't always villains and the good guys weren't always the good guys.Mostly it was good to read the stories of people that would have otherwise been forgotten.",5,1
"I'm getting pretty miffed at people who download every book that's free and then trash the ones they should have skipped in the first place!That the book is free doesn't make it bad; I'm a cheapskate and I've had great experiences with many free books.  You know why?  I get the sample and then decide.  If a book doesn't make it past the first chapter, I simply delete it and don't bother to review.I didn't love this story, but I feel compelled to defend it because most of the ratings are not fair and will mislead fans of the genre.And there's no doubt, some people are going to like this.  It's one of those zany comedies with crazy characters like the cross-dressing fortune teller who uses a disco ball instead of a crystal ball.I'm not really a fan of that style and I found myself skipping through quite a bit, but the story is cute and has some hot parts.  As Randy on AI would say, it was just okay for me, dawg.Quick story with decent conflict and characters, if you can get past all the dumb humor, there is a story here.  Detailed sex with graphic language.",3,1
This book pretty much starts off smoking hot and doesn't let up. Yes its pretty much love at first sight and sex within moments of meeting each other. But I was instantly interested in the book although the whole issue with the witch was way to easily solved.  But thankfully there is another book to this series and I hope that we will have more of Silas and Martha.,4,1
"Too many lazy shortcuts in this book.  It seems like the author didn't want to have to think about the characters--so she picked out a bunch of stereotypes.  Item one: two nasty sisters squabbling with each other constantly about who's hotter.  Item two:  every member of the large family agreeably leaping into their assigned role, which is even listed in case we're too stupid to figure it out.  Item Three: the Irish mom who reads the minds of her 30-year-old daughters and everyone else. And of course Item Four:  ""mysteries"" cropping up that don't get resolved, probably to sucker you into buying the next installment (btw:  no chance!). If you can get past all that, you arrive at the heart of this book, which is . . . well, I'm not sure there is a heart.Ugh.  I am a fan of light-hearted escapist fiction, but this was more light-headed.  As in brainless.",1,0
"I enjoyed this series more than I would have expected given that I don't typically like historicals.

"I have been reading a number of less-than-$5 ebooks, and this book is so far the worst of the bunch. The author seriously needs to consult with experts. While the magic scenes are not too bad, however all the battle scenes are consistently terrible. You're not going to deflect a 12-foot hill giant's club the size of a punching bag with a sword, even if it is to ""make contact"".  You're not going to recommend gathering intelligence on the enemy, then sit on your butt for two days in the fort waiting for them to besiege you. You're not going to wait for the enemy to show up at your doorsteps before sending a messenger out for reinforcements, then execute a complex operation to get someone out only to have one of your friends die. You're not going to feel guilty for the length of a book; you're going to feel guilty about that for the rest of your life thinking, ""if only I didn't sit there twiddling my thumbs for *two days* before enemies besieged the fort.""While there are relatively few typos, the author could still use some good editing. The writing voice is generally even, but feels awkward in many places. All the youths are angry teenage brats. The only body language any of them express is grinding their teeth. I hope the Guardians have a decent dental plan.The plot is good enough that I bought and read the next two books in the series. We'll see how that goes.",2,0
"I started out reading this expecting your typical ""love story"".  Well, once I had read a few pages, I literally could not stop until I was done.It's an odd take of the Beauty and the Beast kind of story but with a twist that makes it incredible and hard to put down.It definitely is a feel good story that ends with a happy ending but also leaving the reader with a lesson.  I found that is what made it so awesome to me.  Most romance stories just have the happily ever after thing and that's it.  However this book left me with a lesson about life.  It really is a very well written short story and one I would definitely recommend to anyone.  You don't have to just be a ""romance"" genre reader to enjoy this story.",5,1

"By now the world of Wasteland, a post-apocalyptic earth over 100 years after solar flares in 2012 decimated life on the planet, is at least familiar, if not particularly a fun vacation spot. In fact, this bleak, desolate world is a shattering backdrop for the four novellas by four authors that feature and highlight the four different caste systems that are left for women in that world. Eden Bradley assumes the mantel for the third book and offers us Nitara's story. Born of a Breeder, she has been chosen by her goddess to follow the same path, and educated on all things sensual and sexual from a very young age. She anxiously awaits her ceremony of the sacrifice, where she will ascend to an alter and take her first male, abandoning her virginity and offering her body for reproduction.There's just one teeny tiny little problem. After copulating with the male sacrifice, she will then plunge a dagger into his heart and bathe herself in his blood as entreaty to the goddess for her fertility. For years she's been groomed for and wildly anticipating that day, until a flash of intellect and fear in a fellow novitiate's sacrifice just prior to her own causes her to wonder if the sacrifices are quite the mindless animals she's always been led to believe.Akaash, the Wanderer stolen from his people and his bonded lover Dhatri, is quite certain he's no mindless animal. He's being chained and kept drugged and isolated but for visits from Nitara that are for the purpose of inflaming his sexual need to the point of nearly willing sacrifice and its wreaking hell on his heart and mind. He is broken over the loss of his freedom and his lover, resentful of his impending death and under no illusions about life. He is also drawn to Nitara, despite knowing she is his doom, and the month-long preparation becomes time for them to share their minds and hearts as well as what limited abilities they have to share bodies. Can Nitara can save them both from the heinous crime against humanity that approaches? Will she dare? She is his only hope.I have to say, I have no complaints with the narrative and development of plot with this novella. It was considerably more fleshed out in both character and conflict than the previous entry,Wasteland: The Whoreby Lilli Feisty. I have, however, a significant problem with this particular novella that hearkens to my reason for reading erotic fiction to begin with. Obviously the best of the bunch offer a solid story with likable characters and, for my personal tastes, a happy ending along with smoking sex scenes that titillate and arouse. Well, in The Breeder, the sex was hot, and there was plenty of it, alternating from self gratification to M/F to M/M/F, and I had no complaint about that, but here's the thing...it's really hard for me to enjoy an erotica novella that starts out with the brutal slaughter of a man followed by the murderess slathering her body with his still hot blood.Call me crazy, but that's not quite the sensual, sexual image that fosters a lot of yummy feelings, and it does nothing to endear me to the world in general and the story in particular. While the first two books also paint a grim picture of the world of Wasteland and a somber view of the decline of the human race, they also offer something that this one didn't quite manage to pull off...hope. I don't think I'll be spoiling too many people if I say that yes, there is a ""happy"" ending in this novella. That's assumed going in. But what continues to bother me is that it's ""happy"" only for the three main characters, Nitara, Akaash, and Dhatri. It's less happy for the victims-in-waiting of the next sacrifice, or Nitara's twin brother, castrated as a child and forced into servitude of the novitiates because their mother ran off with a Wanderer years ago. Without the hope for a brighter future for all, this novella left me feeling way too disturbed and focused on the bad big picture, not on the eroticism of the three leads. Nor did I think that the emotional connection between Nitara and Akaash, and then Dhatri, was sufficiently explored or developed to help keep the focus off the grim reality.Erotic romance is supposed to be erotic and romantic, and unfortunately, due to the circumstances, for me, this one just wasn't, regardless of how well written it was.Books of Wasteland:Wasteland: The Wanderer,Wasteland: The Whore,The Breeder: Wasteland, Book 3,The Priestess: Wasteland, Book 4Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",2,0
"I have read many books with in this genre. They seem to fall into two categories. Either they are well written, well thought out love stories that just happen to have more than one partner in the mix. (Note: Maya Bank's Colters' series.) Or the stories are like this book: The Perfect Union. Too quick with the declaration of love. Too quick agreeing to a relationship like the men were proposing, and too quick with the sex. Even the acceptance from friends and family seemed to be automatic, as if this type of relationship happened every day.It is obvious to me that the writer wanted to get the three together so that their sexual attraction can be written. I am a writer as well, so I believe I understand the motivation. She probably had a series of ideas she wanted to accomplish with the book. But I believe she rushed through them, as if doing so off of a check list. Situations have to be worked through carefully and slowly if they are to be believable.Finding love, especially after the death of someone that meant a lot to a person, isn't easy. Sure, there are those times when the sparks fly, but the widow or widower often feels squeamish about having another relationship. Add children to the mix and, I'm sorry, they don't have sex on the kitchen floor when their children are due home any minute. A mother will do what she can to shield her children and reassure them that they are what is most important to her.The way Rick and Conor are accepted by the children is believable, don't get me wrong. They were in the boys' lives since they were infants. The children never knew their father so having them around was normal to them. But I am only half way through the book, and no where did Calleigh wonder what their father would think bringing someone else (or two someones) into their lives as a father figure.I don't understand Calleigh's spouting of their relationship to strangers either. And the storyline about the coworker who thought he was her boyfriend was so unbelievable, especially since he wasn't mentioned since the only date they had months before.As I said, I have only read half of this book. I haven't gotten to the part where Kevin's parents show up, but I'm sure it will be as the rest of the book is. Contrite and off of the same checklist.The prose is choppy. The conversations are more than choppy. I don't feel that this story is anything more than a poor version of what can be found on one of the erotic story sites. I'm sure that Ms. Lane had good intentions, but I feel that this story could have been so much more if it didn't seem as though it was rushed, and if it had more feelings in it. I guess what I am trying to say is that this story 'tells' us what is happening. We don't 'feel' it. Just because it is written down, doesn't mean that it is so. The reader has to feel the events unfold before she can believe that they are happening.I gave it one star instead of none because the sex scenes were believable, not contrived positions that only the author would see. I felt no passion between the three lovers, no angst, no real love and affection. All I have seen so far is sex.Yes, the sex is good. I will give it that. But please... Nothing else is believable.",1,0

"The title makes it sound like a parody of &#34;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&#34; -- which it is not.What it IS, and you wouldn't think so from the title or cover, is VERY derivative detective noir.

As a military veteran I have found this series to be a blast to read. The character development is such that you really get to know them and it hurts you when one of them is hurt or God forbid killed. The author makes it a point to let you know the good guy dosen't always win or live to see tomorrow. Do what I did and get the entire series and read them one right after the other.

"I agree with the reviewer who asked why does every hero have to be a slut!!! It was like I could not STOP hearing about his blonde bimbos!!! She was of course, celibate for 8 years and he went through women like a child does candy!!! It was gross and made me believe that he did not have any love for the heroine. I am sick of writers making it look like a man only sleeps with women for a need to be fulfilled. That is not true. Yes, they can keep out the emotional attachments but they still get excited over the woman they are with (they kind of have to). I hate thinking that another woman can so easily take the place of the heroines in these stories. Who cares that there is not emotion in the hero's couplings, he still thinks about how many women he went through and how they dressed sexily when the heroine was wearing comfortable clothes, and let us not forget the thought of how his past women were willing to do explicit things to him!! That was gross and unneeded for the story! I actually started out liking him in the first chapter before it skipped ahead 8 years and to a completely different guy and a douchebag to boot! He also manipulated the heck out of a situation to get his way, harming the heroine and potentially harming the child if the press would have gotten worse. He did not think about anything but himself and his wants. He was NO HERO!!!!",1,0

Men don't glide, cattle bawl, they don't bray.  Mules and donkey bray!  And on and on.  I think the author had a good idea for a story, but she just had a first novel or juvenile attempt at this one.

It's just too bad their sexual relationship will only last through the weekend, and then it's back to her safe, staid existence. Or so she thinks.Antonio Villareal is every inch a Master.  His sexual exploits are legendary and Jane can attest that he's definitely a wonderful lover.  Only she hasn't fully experienced everything he's got to offer because he hasn't introduced her to his best friend Santos yet.  Antonio and Santos enjoy sharing a woman and Jane's about to experience being mastered by not one but two men.Jane and her best friend and business partner, Lily's company R.S.V.P. is responsible for setting up the events this weekend. However, it's their extracurricular activities that are holding their attention.  Jane's caught up in her sexual encounter with Antonio and the new knowledge that he shares women with his best friend Santos.  She has to admit that it's a fantasy she enjoys but never seriously considered being in such a situation herself - until cornered by Antonio and Santos.Her friend Lily had her own sexual experience but her emotions are in a tizzy over the event.  Lily and Jean Jacques are strong minded individuals and he's definitely a Dominant male so the simple fact that she won't accept his dominance over her is going to cause all sorts of problems.  Jealousy, hurt, and a power struggle are at the forefront of their relationship.  Can they get past their need for control and admit to their feelings?I've reached the conclusion that Dominique Adair is a cruel woman - or maybe she just enjoys teasing us - in either case, she's definitely got me hooked with her JANE PORTER stories!  These stories capture your attention from the very beginning, build your anticipation, engage your emotions - and then you discover that you'll have to wait for the next story to find out what happens next - and believe me, you'll want to know what happens next.  These characters are highly memorable, the sex scenes are beyond hot and conversations are delightfully wicked.  I've got a real fondness for Jane, Antonio and Santos, but I have to confess it's Lily and Jean Jacques battle of wills that really holds my attention and makes `angry sex' so very appealing.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",5,1

"Okay, before buying this book I read all the reviews which were mostly favorable. I was excited to read this story because it sounded like it would be a sweet love story. However, I was sadly mistaken. The story started off okay but then it went down hill from there. I didn't feel any chemistry between the two characters and I'm not talking sexually. Usually you can feel the connection between the characters before they jump into bed, but this story didn't have that. Like I said the premise of the story was a good one, girl LaCher or Cher gets accepted to Juilliard and is mistakenly assigned a guy Rene as her roommate because his name sounds like a girls name. They decide to make the best of it and remain roommates. They faced a few obstacles which eventually were resolved but by that point in the story I didn't care.

"Wow! What an excellent thriller!Parallax is my second fiction read by Jon F. Merz after I got a taste of his short story and I'm definitely hooked. This was an awesome thriller with lots of twists and turns that I didn't see coming. I love stories that take me off guard and deal with complex characters that don't seem as if they're who they are, only to turn your expectations of them right on the side.The story deals with Frank Jolino and Ernst ""Stahl"", two expert assassins living on opposite sides of the globe in different lives until one fateful moment of mental interlinking brings them together. Soon each is allowed to view the other's experience as if they were perched on the other's shoulder. Their lives interconnect from jobs to love lives and betrayal while each have something in the balance. With Stahl, his son's life is at stake on the condition that he kills a scientist connected with the SARS disease. With Frank, he is sent to kill his old girlfriend, the long lost niece of his mafia boss who he still is in love with, on suspicion that she is connected with the feds.This was one novel that was hard to put down. Merz excels at creating engaging characters wrapped in a fast paced read. One moment I was sympathizing with them and the other felt the complete opposite. Overall, my nose was in the pages all the way to the very satisfying end.This is a late entry for the best of my 2009 reads and it goes right at the top. I hope Parallax makes it to the big screen like Merz's Fixer series is coming to television. I'd definitely grab a ticket!",5,1

I really liked them both but i would like to have seen him do some serious apologizing and maybe some groveling as well.Overall, not bad but not great.

"WTH:  there are so many inconsistencies in this story and scenes that you make cringe:- the female lead is supposedly devastated by her 4-way with the brothers back in high school days that she cuts them off.  This is the whole premise of her resistance to them yet it is also related that as a teenager she and her one of the brothers would openly have sex in front of the other brothers (oh but the other brothers were told to turn their backs so no worries there, yeah right).- she quickly succumbs to having sex with her old boyfriend out in the open (uh, she's so worried about people noticing her sex life, what about the ranch hands who can see the pool area?)- really thought she and the brothers came off as totally dumb that they never practiced birth control (they wanted to keep it exciting), you just can't respect or appreciate characters that stupid, particularly when they're in their mid-20s- the ending orgy scene with the brothers' best friend was just bizarre- the sex she had with her boyfriend in the past had to have been when she was 16/17 and there was a lot of it; that just made me squirm",1,0

"Sure this was written decades before I was born but the stories are no less terrifying for their age. Lovecraft is surely a step above contemporary horror writers in so many ways. The guy does not have to use a plethora of vulgar language, nauseating scenes of sexual violence, or even hundreds of pages to scare the senses out of the reader.

"Right and wrong are not always obvious. ""Vengeance"" follows Owen Dunham, who is investigating the trail of a figure who is called the 'Grudge Ninja'. With little lead on the Ninja's motives, he is shocked when he does start to learn of the truths, and begins to doubt the integrity of his lead. The Grudge Ninja's methods may be wrong, but could its mission be right? ""Vengeance"" is a thriller that dwells in shades of gray with many different characters with different motives and codes, highly recommended.",5,1
"The Forsyte Saga Collection was truly epic and a riveting story of human nature and the period in which the drama takes place.

"Actually I purchased this by mistake. I was looking at novels by Murakami Haruki and this one was in the ""other books"" section. All of the Murakami books are not available on Kindle for me in my area (Asia) which was disappointing. This one was, and as I thought it was Murakami (a fantastic Japanese contemporary author, by the way) I snapped it up. It was only when I was almost at the checkout that I realized the author was not Murakami. But I went forward and purchaed it anyway, to see what it was like, and also because I needed another book for my commuting to and from work.This book had an interesting concept, and the way it was written was interesting. I didn't really like the whiney main character but the fact that the author could evoke ""dislike for a character"" in me makes for good writing.The message in the story was good, and I subscribe to it whole heartedly.The ending was flat, as if the author ran out of time and just whipped out something to get the book in under the wire. I think it could have ended differently, and been a much better book.I'm glad I downloaded this book because it saved me a few dollars from a hard copy, and for three stars, the paperback price would have caused me to downgrade to two stars.",3,1
"MadnessLet me start off by getting the bad news out of the way, telling you what issues I had with Madness, by Sorcha MacMurrough:Sweet Lord, the spelling errors!  I am more than willing to forgive an error or two in a good book.  It can even be fun to spot them, it makes you feel clever and perceptive.  Not so in Madness, there were so many, many errors that it became more of a challenge to try to ignore them!  I was seriously disappointed by this because it knocked what could have been a great book down to just a good book, if your willing to overlook the mistakes.Editors, help!  There were a few charactors whom could have done with more development, less repetition.  Along the same lines, I felt like the book could have lost a few chapters, sped things along and been made better for it.  Also, I have to say that I wish addiction and mental illness could be addressed in reality as simply as it is in this book.  Not that this aspect was handled badly, just that it contradicts conventional understanding of both topics.  Its simplified, I guess I would say.  My final complaint is the ending... without giving anything away, I will say that there are some remarkable coincidences and unimaginable good luck.  Something more practical may have been better.Now, all of that being said, I did enjoy this book.  I can honestly say that this book is very different from other romance novels I've read.  For one thing, the main female character, Gabrielle, is the hero of the story.  She literally and figuratively rescues her man, Simon.  Gabrielle is a strong, determined, hard working woman who knows her own mind.  She is not afraid to do what she has to in order to protect the people she loves.  She isn't afraid to go against conventional society norms and make choices and decisions that are right for her, what will make her happy.  Gabrielle was resourceful and stubborn in an endearing way.  She was the kind of character that you wanted to see happy at the end of the story.As for the Hero of the book, Simon... What can I say?  Simon is the kind of man every girl wants to find and keep forever.  Simon is smart, strong, handsome, loyal but with horrors in his past and demons that only his Lady Love can help him overcome.  Simon was passionate, sweet, thoughtful, brave and absolutely devoted to his Lady.  He has an insatiable love and lust for Gabrielle and he is determined to fight to transform himself into the kind of man who is worthy of her love.  One thing that I really appreciated about this story is the fact that Simon's intelligence was celebrated instead of down played or perceived as a weakness.  He's a hot hunk of man, but with a brain and a huge heart.While the physical relationship between Gabrielle and Simon doesn't begin immediately, once it begins... its on!  There was A LOT of sex in this story.  Tastefully done but abundant. The plus side to this, perhaps, is that the love that Gabrielle and Simon feel for one another is obvious and sweet, which for me made the banquet of sex less pointless or tedious.I would recommend this book to friends, with the aforementioned caution on the spelling and grammar errors.  If the small issues I mentioned were fixed, I would have given this book 5 stars.  The characters and the love they shared was solid gold, the story was interesting and manages to draw you into the dark corners that these characters visit, then usher you back to the light with the love they discover with one another.  Madness was worth the read, good enough that I'm not going to include a pun based on the title in my review.",4,1
"This was a great story. I loved each of the 3 chapters.I wish it had been an entire book, so that I could get more background on the 'whys' of the 2 main characters.I have to wonder what the 'One Star' reviewers expected. I mean the name implies it is about Serial Killers. The blurb was right on target.Of course it's gruesome & disturbing & sick.Geez, have those reviewers reviewed Peter Pan and given it 1 star because ""it's a kid's book"".It's pretty ridiculous to rate a book low because it fits its genre.",5,1
"Coulters&#8217; Wife is a novella length romance.  (Please note where the apostrophe is in that title.)  Holly is &#8220;married&#8221; to three brothers, Ethan, Adam and Ryan.  The four of them live in an isolated location in the mountains and when the story opens, Holly is very pregnant with their first child.  She is upset because she wants to have sex, but the brothers agreed no more sex until after the baby comes.  The plot basically revolves around Holly getting the brothers alone and seducing them one by one.  When Holly goes into labor early, the brothers must work together to deliver the baby on their own.This book was creepy on so many levels.  I don&#8217;t really have a problem with m&eacute;nage relationships, but brothers???  That&#8217;s just icky.  Then, they live up on this mountain semi-isolated from people&#8230;this is how bad religious cults are formed, not sexy love stories.  Add into the mix that they are bringing a child into the world whose family tree will go in circles and the hair on my arms prickled.

"I read the first book and I really enjoyed it.  I enjoyed it so much I bought the 5 volume collection.  But then the book went down this absurd path about homosexuality between animals and became sick and disgusting.I couldn't even read it anymore because I got sick of the parts about the animals making love and all the talk about the difference between cat penises, dog penis, a fox penis and so on.If you're not into gay beastieality animal porn then don't read it.",1,0

"Everyone knows I have a huge hero complex. There are times I want my female strong and there are times I want her knight in shining armor to come charging in to save her. Depends on the books and certainly depends on the characters. A Wicked Wolf got off to a slow start for me  story wise. I did throughly enjoy all the sex, and there was a ton of if being an erotic novel. But I found the story line to be slightly lacking. First and foremost the main character comes off as what Lafayette from True Blood might call a HOOKAH. The first scene involves Randi taking matters into her own hands while driving up a dirt road into the mountains. She seems completely surprised that her exploits cause her to miss that deer jumping into the road and wrecking her car into a ditch. Well how is one supposed to engage in that, while thinking about all the random men she wants to hook up with AND keep her eyes on the road?When she meets her savior, J.R who is really Nick, the man she supposed to be closing a major land development deal with, she is instantaneously turned on. Seems she is in her breeding cycle and JR, a Lycan, can't keep his hands off her. Every time they come up for air they are quickly sucked back into the tiring sexual exploits again. Very Kinky exploits I might add...they were WOW.  Since JR is withholding the information that he is indeed a werewolf, there is a lot of exploits with Randi facing away from him...if you catch my drift. This all happened by chapter two which is the norm for a erotic romance, however with this particular book I wasn't in any way connected to the characters yet.One thing at this point catches my attention. Randi has two teenage siblings at home depending on her closing this land deal to better their lives and send them to college. And yet she has no regard for being gone for almost an entire week with no contact with them. WHAT? Either she doesn't care very much, or they are way to used to her running off with random strange men. She makes a point to think about the fact that she has disappeared for several days at a time with no word to them before. Honestly, I think the brother and sister should have been just left out of the story, because their existence make Randi come off as a sex crazed starlet who doesn't care about her actions as long as she is satisfied.I did love that Randi was so completely trusting of JR when she found out what he was. Yes, there is the initial balking in terror, but his sensual touch is just so hot she needs to succumb to him anyway. The first time they make love facing each other is much sweeter than the rest of their animalistic couplings you expect with a shapeshifter romance.What I wanted more of was the mystery surrounding JR's (aka Nick) murdered wife. I wanted more *ahem* action...However that whole side story line doesn't unravel until near the end and is over quite quickly. I wanted more ongoing threat to Randi, more wolf form for Nick and more storyline. I really did not mind all the sex, in fact Brenda does an AWESOME job of writing those scenes. BUT I would have liked more story line, even if it made the book longer.So while the sex scenes were really well wrote and totally engaging, it's not enough for me to love this book. I liked it. I simply wanted more.Nikki- Ramblings From A Chaotic Mind",2,0

"I read this short story because of its authors. Both are great authors and the story had potential. Unfortunately, while a good read, it doesn't live up to its full potential.A driver picks up a hitchhiker. Kills him. A hitchhiker is picked up by two stoners and kills them. Third chapter: The serial killers meet and all hell breaks loose.Except that hell is a little bit predictable. But graphic.I had to read the story twice. I didn't read the description or advance marketing copy before beginning the story so I was not prepared for the POV shift in the second chapter. It confused me until I went back and read it again. The cliffhanger from the first chapter appears to lead in to the second chapter quite naturally, but the POV shift was a shocker until I understood how the authors collaborated and who wrote each part. After that, the story made better sense. That's probably my fault for not reading the promos.Still, the writing is not completely terse. There are parts of it that can be tightened. Adverbs where none are necessary. Sentences that could have been shorter. But these are nitpicks. The plot and story line are actually decently implemented.The problem is the authors could have spent a little more time on the collaborative effort in chapter three to make it more unpredictable. Some of the characterization is a little flat even for a short story. Otherwise, I'd say it was a decent read.Doesn't quite deserve four stars, but it's better than three stars. Probably more like a 3.8.",4,1

"Even though I recently just found Ms. Andre as a writer of erotica and erotic, I absolutely love her books.  This one was no exception.  I enjoyed the premise of three friends on a weekend in wine country, CA.  The description of the vineyards and town made me want to visit the area.  Each character has about 1/3 of the book devoted to her; each story within the book was very good and different.  I loved the first two characters in the first and second parts: Carrie and Rose . . . absolutely fell in love with the chef for more reasons than one, gee he cooks!  Rose's story was the most believable to me (though who really cares how believable it was).  Vanessa was my least favorite character, matter of fact; I really didn't care for her at all until the end, then I changed my mind about her.  However, FOR ME, Vanessa's weekend was by far, one of the most erotic stories I have ever read . . . the words, scenarios and feelings portrayed were beautiful; at one point, I had tears running down my cheeks because the writing was so poignant . . . wow!  It's a keeper that I'll read over-and-over when I want to be entertained and on a 3-day getaway.",5,1
"This novella is the story of Victoria Paget and Tom Godfrey.  Others have already given the plot so I won't repeat it here.The story is short and more than half the story seems to be hot sex scenes between the characters.

I did enjoy the novella, however, and would recommend it.",3,1

"This book does not try to take itself too seriously. The author does not bog us down with reams of technobabble, or try to impress us with his knowledge of theoretical physics.It is a good story, filled with well developed and interesting characters. Most importantly, it is funny. As much as I enjoy science fiction, I also enjoy having a good laugh, and I got plenty of both here.Around 80%, there were of number of technical errors with the text, with some paragraphs repeating, and some missing entirely. It could be I got a bad download, or maybe a glitch in my device. Either way, I do not hold that against the author. However, there were a number of grammatical errors which I did find distracting. Still, the book overall was very good, and I will probably read more from this author.",4,1

"Review by Lori: I picked this book to read because of it's cover. I know I know, never judge a book by it's cover, but the cover really grabbed my attention and pulled me in. So, even though this is a short read, it's really packed with a punch. Caitlyn and Sean are married, she wants to divorce him, he doesn't want his marriage to end. Sean is a cop who's got some bad guy after him and possibly anyone else close to him, so Sean needs to protect his wife much to her chagrin. Sean likes being in control and Caitlyn feels as if he doesn't listen to her which has caused some friction in their marriage. I liked this book. I really liked the idea of the story and the cover kind of hinted at some of the chemistry between the two characters and you shant be dissapointed!! What I had a problem with was because it was a short story, not all of the ideas that the author had could be developed fully. I would have liked to have witnessed the fight that led to their breakup. I wanted to see what their lives were like after she left. I liked the characters, they both were flawed and they loved each other in spite of them. I liked that they hurt each other and their marriage was messy but in the end they loved each other. A happy ending isn't bad either!!!",4,1

"There are, perhaps, a few places where the characters' past history and current personalities might not stand up to close scrutiny -- but the turns of phrase are quite deft, and the characters are simply _fun,_ so I'm not inclined to quibble. The faintest besmirching of the overall entertainment is a duel which has a slight jump and feel of ""insert duel here"" in the author's notes, but that's the only part which got my mind hiccuping.The other reviews cover details quite well enough, and the bits that I really, really liked, I can't say or it'll spoil the snickers. (There is quite a fair dose of humor here and there!) Unfortunately, the first of those is just _after_ the sample text ends.",4,1
"I think I enjoyed Amber Eyes a little more than Golden Eyes, and I thoroughly enjoyed that novella. Kaya was enjoyable to read and watch come to get use to the human world she had long since stopped from trying to enter. Also for Hunter and Jericho to learn to love again.",5,1
"Overall this is a fun story.  It starts a little slow but gets interesting fairly quickly.  It opens with Josh and Ryan meeting, getting nasty and going their separate ways.  With the introduction of paparazzi photos of their indiscretion, the actual story takes off.  There are hidden cameramen, family harassment, stress, arguments and fights to get the ball rolling.  And, once it got going, it was pretty fun.Before the book's climax, it wasn't too difficult to sort out who was behind the photo stalking - although to be honest I was only half right...There are a few sub-plot elements that didn't seem necessary such as including Josh's ex-brother-in-law, but they weren't so prevalent as to get in the way.",3,1

"I subscribed to the Kindle Nation Daily for over a week, taking advantage of the two week free trial.  I'm not going to continue my subscription to the blog.Kindle Nation Daily focuses almost completely on the Kindle, and not on eReaders in general.  It announces free books for the Kindle, and provides a good set of hints for using your Kindle well.  So, why won't I renew my subscription?First, the author of the blog has also created a good user guide for the Kindle.  If you want good hints for using the Kindle, why not just buy his book?  Most of his hints I already knew; I suspect the rest are already in his book.Second, I already have over 300 books to read on the Kindle (most of which were free), and won't have them all read in the near future.  Most of the free books listed for the Kindle are not books I would normally read; none were during the week or so that I read the Kindle Nation Daily.  I get my free Science Fiction from Project Gutenberg and the Baen Free Library (as well as the Baen CDs that I burn).  It'll be a long time before I catch up on my library of available books.I'm also more interested in the interactions between the Kindle and the rest of the industry, both narrowly defined as the eReader industry, and more broadly defined as the publishing industry.  There are other blogs out there with a broader focus.  I'm sure I'll end up subscribing to one of them.  But this blog's focus is just too narrow for me.Another blog you may wish to look at isI Love My Kindle.

"This was my least favorite of the series, I have to say.  It had a little dom in it, which doesn't do it for me, though that really wasn't the problem- it was mild enough to not be a problem.  There seemed to be too much struggle, bad communication, and not as much play as the others, I thought.  Too bad to end with this one, but it does end well, and you kinda need to read this to understand some things in the Bear one, which is the author's next series based in the same town.",3,1

"This is a very short short story.  It's basically a few scenes at a party and one night (though admittedly some entire books have taken over that period,  this one doesn't)  It's pure erotica - has an hea,  but no real relationship, no depth, just sexual descriptions.  I was really disappointed and I have to get used to this kindle notation - I find the lack of page numbers confusing,  so I don't really know what I'm getting into until I down load it.I've not found a m/m regency romance that really does it for me, and we have no idea why these 2 men love each other,  other than their looks.

"Lyla Sinclair is a terrific author.  I have always enjoyed her books immensely.  That being said, ""Training Emily"" was a huge disappointment.  The character Mark Kendall is an angry college professor whose wife left him five years ago.  Emily is his student who is failing his class and who has lusted after him for years.  The premise is good one but it falls far short of what it could have been.  Mark is a wannabe Dom and a cruel b*****d.  What really ticked me off is that Emily kept wondering if she had 'daddy issues'.  Gag me.  (no pun intended).  If this had been the first book I had ever read by this author I never would have picked up any more.  The price is not worth the time or effort that this reader put out.",1,0

"This was a very good story that was very hard to put down.  Using the Baen criteria for science fiction, I found the technology, characters, and situation believable.  I got the Kindle version of this book for under a buck, and I received a heck of a lot more value than a dollar.  The ending left a lot to be desired - it was as if the author suddenly decided he was done and quickly wound it up - it left me and others hanging wanting more: more of a conclusion of what happens to everyone, should we believe there will be a sequel, etc.?I took away one star as this book is in serious need of a proofer / editor.  Many times with the Kindle version there were missing words, incorrect spelling / syntax of words among a few problems.

I love fantasy (that's why I read Stephen King, etc) but fiction I like with some believability. This book, in my opinion, had little. Dialogue was weak, boring and amateurish...in my opinion. I also (foolishly) downloaded her 2nd book before reading this one, but could only read about 10 pages before giving up. I was told, within the onslaught of not-very-nice-either comments to my last review, that this was the author's first book and they do get better.",2,0
"""Dominant Species"" is an enjoyable military Sci-Fi that moves along at a good pace and had enough action to hold my interest all the way though. As other reviewers note, there are a lot of grammar and editing issues that can be distracting but not so much that it overly detracted from my immersion into the story.No spoilers from me: The story centers on a special forces team of ""United Systems"" Marines, complete with powered battle armor, that are tasked with a mission on a remote mining planet. The characters have very specialized functions on the team (Leader, Sargent, Scout, Sniper, and Medic) and the author does a good job building the sense that they are a cohesive unit. During the course of their mission, things take an unexpected turn and they find themselves in a totally different situation than the one they were sent to deal with. Also in the mix are an unstable environment, a hapless prisoner and an unexpected enemy.This was a good read while traveling and I would read more by the author.Recommended for fans of the genre.CFH",4,1
"MY SOUL TO LOSE is a prequel to the Soul Screamers series. It tells the story of what happened to Kaylee during the week she spent in the psychiatric unit referenced in My Soul to Take.Nash makes a brief appearance early on, but that's it. And there aren't any other romantic interests for Kaylee in MY SOUL TO LOSE either. Most of this short story revolves around her enduring the many indignities of being committed. There is also a mystery introduced with the character and fellow patient Lydia that I'm hoping will be further explained in future books.As an audiobook, and I'm a huge audiobook fan--they're an insomniac's best friend--MY SOUL TO LOSE is pretty good. The narrator is not great, but not distractingly bad a la the narrator for the Twilight Saga. You can listen to a sample before downloading if you're worried. The story is short, only 1 hour and 48 mins. But it provided the perfect little visit back to the folklore infused Soul Screamers universe.This isn't a perfect series, but all the Soul books, including this prequel, have all been light and fun reads. My Soul to Keep is due out on June 1, 2010. I'm already eager for another good scream.Sexual Content: References to sex",3,1
"After serious contemplation, my opinion is that sensitive readers may want to take a pass on this uneven and, in places, somewhat unpleasant book.Part of the problem is the subject matter, part is the uneven writing, and part is the character of Homicide Inspector John Richetti, a highly-stressed hard-drinking policeman who was caught up in the Jonestown cult as a child in the `70s -- the one where 900 people drank the Kool-Aid.At times, Richetti is so dimwitted and irresponsible that even his undercover partner calls him a ""stupid bastard."" Here's one example: He gives seven sleeping pills -- seven! -- to a cult member not used to taking them (this isn't a bad guy) and the person almost doesn't wake up. Here's another: Despite being specifically warned not to tell the truth because admitting personal weaknesses lets the cult get their hooks into you, he openly admits his involvement at Jamestown. He always knows best and he's always wrong.In fact, neither of the investigators, Richetti or Marilyn Michaelsen, the police department psychologist who accompanies him under cover, is up to the task -- the supremely dangerous job of infiltrating the Earthbound cult and bringing two suspected murderers to justice. But at least Michaelsen has some brains and self control. Richetti is a fool.But here's the crux of it.If you're touchy about abusive situations involving children or violent rape or coercive acts involving feces (I'm sorry, there's just no oblique way to say it), you should really consider giving this book a wide berth. At the part about forced coprophagia about two-thirds of the way in -- hey, you're going to have to look it up, I'm not defining it -- I almost put the book down in disgust. And at the end, I'm not so sure I shouldn't have stopped there. Your tolerance for this kind of writing may vary, of course.",2,0

Second, I'm not sure I buy Ty' s declaration of love at the end...maybe...but it bugs me...it's like I was asked to flip a switch and now he loves her because of one realization.

"The story was ok, but I was under the impression that this was going to be a steamy, fast read.  It's about an admirals daughter who is a lawyer by day and a stripper by night (hence the cover of a naked girl in a butterfly G-string).  The free download I received had very little steam.  Almost no love scenes at all in fact.  And there were so many non sequiturs that at times I was very confused.  One minute she is with her love interest at home, and the next she is in court, but without the leading sentence that takes you there.  It was as if entire sentences or paragraphs were missing.  As for the fast read, it was 28 chapters long, so you judge if that is a fast read or not.  Overall, I thought the book had good characters and a good story idea, but it was unfinished, and was missing a lot to keep in the plot.",2,0
"If you have a lot of time, this book may be for you. Personally, I have never had the time in the mornings to cook a great breakfast and then make these recipes for school lunch boxes. Most are things the kids will not eat even though, as the book says, would be better for them. I had much rather give the kids a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a cookie, with a piece of fruit I know they will eat than something they are going to throw away once they get out of sight of the house.",1,0
"1. What the *bleep* I'm confused about the ending did they actually meet or she dreamed the whole thing and in the end they left but WHAT HAPPEN when  they left to go out.2. The beginning  was ok getting into it and next thing I know they are having sex which is ok because I don't mind I like erotica, but they kept going at it sex, sex with freaky stuff him mixing things with her private parts, more sex. I think they came up for air but who knows.3. After they met, the rest of the book was filled with sex, then the end. I guess the story is about the emerald but the title should have been called ""lets see how many times we can have sex by the ocean and be freaky with it"". I don't mind that much sex but give a plot a story something in between but back to back sex was overly done the one thing that kept going through my head was Again when they went at it. Cheap books aren't always better4. Never thought I would say this and I love erotica books but I'm assuming porno movies has better story line and plot than this book.Ps: that felt so wrong to say.**************************",2,0

"Orphaned Wiley had a hard life, unceremoniously abandoned as a child and having to cope that she transforms into an ugly hairy unknown creature when she feels very intense emotions. Well, her life was about to become harder when she stumbles across others of her own kind, one of which is a hot prince who happens to be her betrothed!The book starts off well enough and I quite like the author's writing style. The plot in this book is similar to The Charmer, except told from the perspective of Wiley. If so, it would have been expected that there would have been more plot, or additional twist and turns to give life to this novel. Unfortunately, this was not to be, you ocassionally had word for word replication of certain scenes in The Charmer. The major flaw in this book was that it turned out to be a unconcluded short novel and ended with a ""Read The Charmer to find out how it all ends!""WHAT?!?!?!?!You have got to be kidding me! Short story + overlap in plot + no conclusive ending?!?!?!?! Especially when this novel is $2.99, which is more expensive than the other books in the Darkland series!! If this was made clear in the product description (that it's a prologue or short prequel to The Charmer), I would not feel so disgruntled. Save your money and read The Charmer (a really good novel) which has a much stronger plot and is cheaper to boot!",1,0
"Straight out of prison jewelry thief Alex falls in love with jewelry store owner Celeste after promising his thief father that he'll grab a very expensive piece from her store.  Instead of stealing it, he takes her to dinner and sex ensues.This is a freebie.  Almost everyone that reviewed it pointed that out.  But it bears repeating.  Sometimes the freebies are just horrible, but this one is decently edited and the plot - though preditable in the end - is engaging enough to keep you reading.I liked both main characters.  What I would have liked to know is if there was a reason why Alex's father wanted the bracelet so badly, other than who it had belonged to originally.  It appeared that there was more going on there than an acquisition, but it was never elaborated.At any rate, it's a short book with a few good sex scenes and some tension and drama thrown in for good measure.  While their backgrounds could have used more detail, I don't regret downloading and reading it, and that's a good measure of a free book's value in my opinion.",3,1
"In this present world I guess it would be nice to escape from the realities of life and live in a fantasy.  However, God does not work through fantasy but through good and bad times in the lives of real people. Not only did I not particularly like this story, I thought it was not well written.  It would have been better without its ""spiritual"" aspect.  God works througth reality and answers real prayers.  He is not a genie in a bottle!  Dumb story and a waste of time!",2,0
"One reviewer compared this novel to a Nascar wreck...maybe not quite that bad, but it was impossible for me to read.  I made it through 15% and just quit.  I won't repeat some of the other glaring issues pointed out because there is no point.  Misused words, attitude about women and how they would behave while under the stain of the world being assaulted by nature, ugh.  Yes, I'm sure crawling off for a one night stand with a survivalist is on my list of the first thing I want to do....if the world was ending.The story premise is not bad but editing could make it a lot stronger and more readable.  My suggestion is to listen to the book read.  The errors will jump out.  Conversation is conversation.  Women are multi-dimensional and not just walking plastic dolls.  Cops don't make suggestions about love lives....unless they are friends or you're getting beat up.Just too many problems with this book for me to continue.  Sorry",2,0
"Wow, how much can you really say about a three chapter story.  I thought both characters were great, and a full fledge book could have been written about either one.  The concept of facing two serial killers, both who prey on unsuspecting hitchhikers, against each other is brilliant.  I would have loved to read more about each of their prior victims, what made them become serial killers, what are the authorities doing about them.  You just know that this story line would support the grizzled old veteran homicide detective trying to catch them.  I really enjoyed the concept of the story, but wish it would have been more.  Horror fans will enjoy Serial, and I recommend it to anyone that likes good characters, interesting plot...oh yea, and blood and guts!",4,1

"-- No spoilers --I bought my Kindle with the intent to buy and read low-priced novels from unknown and indie authors. So far, that experience has been pretty rewarding. City of Rogues made me pause, though. This novel has the foundation to be good book, but is lacking in important areas.The best part of City of Rogues is the pace and action. There is constant action, and the plot moves forward at a good pace, certainly not too slow, but also not too fast. The plot helps the pacing, but is pretty straightforward. The language is clear and makes for an easy read. The action scenes are written quite well. The level of worldbuilding is satisfying, even original in places, and hints at some interesting matters which may become relevant later in the trilogy.I was mainly disappointed by the characters. Ty Johnston created some promising characters, notably Kron, Belgad , Gris, Markwood and Randall, and to a certain extent also Lucius, Adara, Wyck and Stilp. But the promise never develops into something more, as the characters stay two-dimensional, and at several junctions in the story make some head-scratching decisions based on weak explanations. Also, I never had the feeling that I really got into the characters skin, and had trouble to identify with them and care for them. The fact that the POV would jump from character to character, often in mid-scene, didn't help at all. On the flip side, Johnston at least did paint most of the characters grey, with the villains showing some positive traits, and the heroes some bad ones. It just wasn't developed enough, much to my regret.Overall, this book shows some promise, and I may end up buying the next book. But City of Rogues could have been so much better, and it is a pity that it isn't.",3,1
"I actually read the 2nd book in this series several years ago.  This book was a little harder to read at first due to the sentence structure. The story was very good but I took one star off due to some missed words, misspelled words, a couple of words used that when looked up didn't even match any description in The American or UK Dictionary. (Totally out of context)  That being said once I got past that this is a good book, interesting, sexy, erotic book.  I Know that I will save this book and reread it again. I would love to see another book from this series and I would definitely buy it. For 7.99I would appreciate Ms. Dane giving this book to an editor!",4,1

"Absolutely chilling.  The fact that unstable, psychotic killers can blend into society so well is what made this story so scary for me.  The writing was fast paced, the action suspenseful, and the plot very plausible.  Dan's character and escalating instability was very well written.  I do think Melissa's character could have been fleshed out a bit more as I really didn't get a very good understanding of her.  Just when I thought the story was finished and I felt safe again, thinking Dan and Melissa could settle down into their relationship instead of running for their lives, here comes a surprising gut-punching twist that left my heart racing.",4,1

"I stumbled across `Seducing a Stranger' while looking for another book with a similar title,Strangers Just This Night: Sweet Erotic Romanceby Sandra Ross.  It looked like a good book, so I downloaded it and gave it a quick read, and am very glad I did!`Seducing a Stranger' is a historical erotic story that really puts you in the world inhabited by the characters.  Victoria Paget is a widow seeking proof that her husband, a Captain, was murdered.  She resorts to going to a bawdy house to seduce the Lieutenant that she suspects is responsible for her dear husband's death.  She feels that she has to do this so she won't let him down in death the way she feels she did during his life.  She is a strong, vivid character that is easy to relate to and impossible not to like.Tom Godfrey is the sexy young Lieutenant that is believed by Victoria to be behind her husband's death.  He turns out to be gentlemanly and is extremely surprised to find the widow of his previous Captain in the bawdy house, and he falls instantly in love with her.  Of course, this being an erotic story, I should probably say he fell in lust with her, lol!  The two quickly become involved in a hot, steamy relationship that is put to the test when Victoria finally discloses her beliefs about Tom.I liked the historical aspect of the story, and the author did a good job keeping the language and description appropriate for a historical story.  Although it is hard to develop characters that are believable and likeable in a short story, the author did a commendable job.  I especially like Victoria and the fact that she was willing to go to such extreme measures to get her dead husband the respect she felt he deserved.  I am not sure I could put myself in such a dire situation as selling my body just for answers, and the time period in which the story takes place would have made that an extremely risky endeavor for a widow to undertake.Tom was also a great character; although a true gentleman wouldn't be in a bawdy house in the first place, so that put me off him a little bit.  However, the sexy bits were sizzling and fit the story perfectly.  The descriptions used were exciting and appropriate, and they made the story really stand out.  I would say that if I found other works by this author I would probably read them since I enjoyed this one so much.  I would definitely recommend this book to others, and even though it was not the book I was looking for, it was just right for the mood I was in!",4,1
"I know this book got glowing reviews and I applaud the author for the attempt at a symbolic and spiritual book, but I found it poorly written and much too short to make any kind of impact. The symbolim was so obvious and cliche that I kept looking for some deeper meaning that I may have been missing, but I never found it. This book gave the impression of being dashed off during a lunch hour and could have been much better if it had been written with more time and care.",1,0

"The story was great. I am a big fan of horror/mystery/suspense. This had everything, white knuckle moments, breath holding suspense, a little gore to make you a little sick. My only problem was that it was way too short. I was so intrigued by the story that I wanted it to go on for at least a few more chapters. The story line was there, so did the author run out of ideas? The author needs to read a little Stephen King to learn how to extend a story. What a great creepy one this could have been.",3,1

There is no good way to explain the story without giving too much away (although there really is no beginning, middle, or ending, it just 'is'. )It is easy to read into where the tale is going but then, it doesn't. But that is what makes it good. It is not contrived or common.A quick and quirky tale that left me wanting to read more of Mr. Hill's work.",4,1

"PJVs QUICKIE POV: A smoking hot threesome packed full of vamps, determined heroines and two not just one sexy men.REVIEW: Set in the year 2069, in this futuristic world vampires frolic in all types of sensory explicit behavior at clubs called Midnight Playgrounds. The London club has been calling to Nissa ever since she found out about them. Determined to gain entrance to the club and maybe one day even into the ranks of the undead, Nissa finally makes a contact that gets her invited.On her fist night at the club, Nissa is intent of full-filling her most darkest fantasies - and the Midnight Playground is just the place to do so. Drawn to the upper floors Nissa comes upon Hex and his maker Aleron. Lovers and friends for 10 years they have had no desire to add to their ranks - only to have fun with the humans that visit the club.Nissa immediately strikes them as different thought. Intelligent, sensual and beautiful, Hex is drawn to her like no other - and while he has shared The Seeking Kiss, blood exchange between a vampire and their human lover, with others, he has had no inclination to share the Turning Kiss with one, until now.Interesting and sexy, I did enjoy this one and hope to read more from Ms. Bradley. I found Hex & Aleron's relationship very sexy and a change from the usual - buddies sharing a chick - which is what I've read before in menage erotica.Another short read, and a very cheap listing, on amazon.com for $2.80 here. I love a good book deal!RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, this is a smut fest, erotica novel. Vampires, threesomes and a lot of slaps and tickles.",3,1

"I totally enjoyed this first book in Stormy Glenn's Tri-Omega Mates series. I was intrigued by the description and I was really glad that the story line turned out to have a little more depth than what I was expecting. It was a fun, sexy read that kept me very entertained.Leyland is a photographer on his way to a photo shoot when his car breaks down.  He's not just a photographer, though. He's an omega werewolf who knows he's a Tri-Omega, meaning he's fated to have two mates. Imagine his surprise when he discovers both of them on his photo shoot.Jake and Lucas are the Alpha and Beta, respectively, of a very small pack of gay werewolves. These men all have the same background of having been abused and kicked out of their birth packs at an early age for being gay, considered weak or both. Jake and Lucas have been lovers for ten years believing that mates don't exist for gay men only for those able to provide cubs.Jake recognizes Leyland as his mate and omega but assumes that Leyland, as a human, knows nothing of any of this. Because Jake and Lucas were kicked out of their packs at a young age, much of the werewolf culture is unknown to them so when Leyland announces that they're his mates, he's an omega, and that he'll be mating them both...well, let's just say that shock is the least of the reactions! None of the pack have ever heard of Tri-Omegas so Leyland has his work cut out for him educating everyone on what it means and what his additional powers are.As I said, this was a fun and sexy read that had some differences to the standard stories that made it a little more interesting. I liked all of these mates and I really liked the fact that their pack was so small. It made it truly feel like a family. I am definitely interested in reading more of these in the series.NOTE: This book was provided by Siren Publishing for the purpose of a review on Rainbow Book Reviews [...]",4,1
"I have come to love this  family. I have to say, Mrs. Jackson did a terrific job in showing how close and loving a successful family can be. She has also included friendship, trust, loyalty and respect in all of the relationships.  I love how this family sticks together no matter what and is always there to support one another. All of the books tie together whether you read them in order or not. By the time I finished this book set, I was convinced this would make for a very go. od movie. Better than any of the family movies that have been made recently. Even though Mrs. Jackson can get a little repetitive in some areas, it does not take away from how she has been so family oriented and creative with these love stories. She keeps you wanting to know what is currently going on with the rest of the family and each story gives you an update. I will definitely read her other family series as I am still interested to continue following.",5,1

"I am very bothered by the samples hiding as ""Free Books"" but that is a larger problem. That was 1 star from the score.Another way of knocking this off was the constant push of ""apprentice"".

I think we spent more time agonizing over how hard and horrible it is to the the daughter of an uber-person in this story than anything else.We know very little of the background, where she is, what life is life, etc before stepping into this anxiety fest. For repetitive introspection, I take away another star.The length was disappointing. We encounter no other characters like the main one, only watch her fumble from a porch, a back room, then in her car. I'm sorry, no matter what the writer of Twitlight would have us all believe, being a clutz or clueless/oblivious is NOT an interested flaw. Do you go out of your way to make friends with and enjoy time around knuckle heads all day? No. People need to quit writing like this. Losing yet another star.All in all this story had less to it than essays or reflections on other stories I wrote in some of my college classes. It felt filled with fluff even to make it as far as it did. I'm not at all interested in reading more about this girl or her family because the author did not really try to win my business.

"I gave this book three stars based solely on the fact that it was well written, meaning that grammar and spelling were on point and that the story flowed fairly well. But for me, I think basing this book on the Disney story of beauty and the beast was a bit juvenile. As were parts of the story. Things came to a head much too quickly for it to have been believable and the heroine going from, &#34;I hate this guy&#34; to &#34;well, I guess I can give him a chance&#34; was too much for me to take in. Overall, I thought this book was corny beyond belief and makes me wonder if other books the author has written as like this one.

This is a sweet read about true love.  Everyone always has a day that they want to do over. This couple gets so much more than just a do over. AJ and Cooper will continue to try until they get it right whether they want to or not. The Gods don&#8217;t give second chances so easily and when they do they make you work for it. Is their love strong enough to break the cycle or are they going to chase their dreams forever?I enjoyed Cooper and AJ&#8217;s story. The two truly love one another and make a great couple. As they work through their past mistakes the love that they have for each other shines through and they only need to grab it.  As we watch the two repeat their day we see so much happen with just a split second decision in your day so much can change. It was interesting to see how their day would unfold with each new decision and with each change their bond only grows stronger.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.,4,1

"This book has shown up in my Amazon 'recommended for you' list for years, and I have always ignored it.  I also wondered why it was suggested.  I'm not normally in the habit of purchasing books about pet fetishes.  But I have purchased every book by Maren Smith and Denise Hall, which I now understand are also names that Darla Phelps publishes under, and I have loved almost every one of those books so I decided to give this a try.  And when I finished this in a few hours - quickly purchased books 2 and 3 (gotta love the BUY button on the Kindle). A previous reviewer suggests you will never look at your pet the same and I agree.  You may never look at any animal the same!  These books have plenty of the stuff that makes Maren Smith and Denise Hall some of my favorites.  With the added bonus that there is a great plot and the story telling is excellent.  These are not always present at the same time with books in this genre.  I can't believe I waited to so long to read these - but at the same time it was a delicious treat to 'discover' them at a point when it seems really good books are harder and harder to come by in this genre.",5,1

"but it's just that, a short story.  I don't care for short stories, if I'm going to invest my time to read, I want plenty of meat and potatoes.  Yes, there's meat in this book, but it's not a full serving.  Is the author talented, yes, probably, but with this book you really don't know if he can hold you for chapter after chapter of reading. So I'm not sure if I will read one of his novels or not, depends, but I probably won't be looking for one, if it pops up on the radar screen, them yes, if not, then no.",3,1

"There were elements to Parallax that I thoroughly enjoyed - characters, style, plot twists & the whole concept of the psychic bond is great. The characters were well connected & credit where it's due to Merz, that psychic bond was very believable & well scripted.But I did have a problem with some of the side characters that I didn't feel were genuine or written from the heart. One particular twist I found so far fetched that I nearly quit reading. And something I tried to get beyond, but it kept bugging me, was Stahl doing a hit to pay for his son's healthcare.... in Germany... which has a universal health system & healthcare is free for kids. Sorry, picky I know but it was mentioned frequently in the book so it kept hitting me in the head.",3,1

This is a really good book. I love the sci-fi affects and the way they put the setting in a sex free camp. And the way the campers all fell in love. This book will be great for anybody who enjoys realistic fantasy and Stephen king.,5,1
"After three decades of teaching High School English, Jesse Ashworth decides to take early retirement and move back to his hometown of Bath, Maine.  His longtime friend and colleague, Rhonda Shepard, had moved to Bath a year earlier and opened a gift shop.  Business is good and Jesse divides his time between helping Rhonda at the shop, getting settled in to his new home, spending ""quality"" time with his pug, Argus, and becoming reacquainted with people he knew back in High School.  After some initial trepidation, Jesse finds that retirement suits him just fine.Just as Jesse is settling into a comfortable routine, he makes a grizzly discovery in his back yard:  the skeletal remains of a young woman who died under suspicious circumstances.  The upside?  Jesse gets to work closely with the very attractive Chief of Police, Tim Mallory.  The downside?  It doesn't take long for Jesse to come to the conclusion that someone he knows is a murderer, and that ""someone"" may just have it in for Jesse himself.This is definitely a ""cozy"" mystery, with the mystery part of the storyline taking a backseat to the characters themselves and the domestic details.  Here's what I look for in a ""cozy"":  (1)  An interesting and unique protagonist; someone I can relate to.  (2)  A strong sense of place.  I want to really get a feel for the setting; I want the location to come alive for me.  (3)  While I'm willing to give ""cozy"" writers a lot of leeway when it comes to the mystery itself, I expect it to be at least respectably plausible.  I'm happy to say that this story had a lot of what I enjoy reading in a ""cozy"" mystery.Jesse's first person narrative really worked.  He's observant and witty with a little snark thrown in for good measure.  I know this area of Maine quite well and I love it, so I really enjoyed the way the author worked ""real life"" details into his fictional story.  In fact, I have a craving for one of Amato's Italian sandwiches - Thanks a lot Mr. Stanley, there goes the diet!  Seriously, if you are familiar with Bath then you'll appreciate the details and if you're not you'll want to go there and see it for yourself.  I also really liked the  way the over 50 crowd was well represented, and (Thank You God)  not portrayed as old geezers lucky to be standing on the right side of the grass.  Nope, Jesse and company are attractive, interesting and relevant.Still, I did waffle between a 3 and 4 star rating, settling on a 3.5 (rounded up to 4 for Amazon).  While I enjoyed this very much, there's no getting around the fact that there were numerous ""typos"" - missing words, misspellings, etc - that required a bit of mental editing on my part as I was reading.  Maybe not a big deal, but anytime you are pulled out of a story -especially a Mystery - it's not a good thing.  There were a few places where the dialog could have flowed more naturally but overall I enjoyed this and plan on reading the next installment.Bottom Line:  A solid ""cozy"" mystery with good characterization and plenty of authentic atmosphere.  The mystery is serviceable, but if you're looking for plot holes, you will find them.  There are editing issues.  There is occasional strong language and while there is no sexual content, a same sex romance is depicted.  If that bothers you then this probably isn't the book for you.Book One:A Midcoast MurderBook Two:Murder in the Choir Room (A Jesse Ashworth Mystery)Book Three:The Big Boys' Detective Agency",4,1

"I enjoyed this short story, it was quick and effortless to read.  Would have been nice to have more details filled in - both for plot and characters - but it probably wouldn't have fit in with the author's direction or purpose.  Unfortunately, this wasn't enough to convince me to pick up any of the author's longer stories.So 4 stars for being a decent enough short story on its own.",4,1

I enjoy reading about serial killers fiction and non fiction. The Jack Daniels books are really good. I am working on reading the series.,4,1
"This book is about a community of witches(or persons with magic powers) who begin to lose select members to a murderer. It's a decent plot, the characters are likeable, and the steamy scenes are hot enough, but it becomes way to simplistic in the end. It turns into a bad Scooby-Doo episode were the murderer steps forward and explains all there reasons and then is just taken away....umm yawn boring. There are some confusing paragraphs off and on where you don't know who is talking and who they are referring too otherwise the author can put together a decent sentence. It's mediocre I would be willing to try another book from this author but don't expect a lot. It was a fast read a couple of hours at most.",2,0
"Words dont't quite sum up my thoughts on this story, rather imagine me rolling my eyes and sighing with deep exaggeration. First of all, the idea that Dario's cat was almost an entire other being just didn't work. The cougar was constantly clawing him from the inside out, rolling around and hitting him with its tail. The so called trauma that Sheridan suffered was almost laughable. For a wolf shifter she was pretty pathetic. She talks about how she had to deal with her alpha brother, but she can't grow a dag-on back bone when it comes to romantic relationships? She even agrees to be a bridesmaid in her ex boyfiends wedding and her 'revenge' is that she and Dario arrive in a super expensive car? What did that accomplish besides showing how materialistic everyone is- including her?When the enevitable conflict arises, she doesn't even wait around to figure out what really happened- just jumped to her own conclusions! At that point, I wished Dario would have just wised up and realized she wasn't worth it.The writing was disjointed and proasiac, and definitely now worth the $4 something I paid for it.",2,0
"What happens when two serial killers happen to stumble upon each other? Yawn, who cares? The graphic descriptions in this book are disturbing and not in a good way.

"I initially bought the official K2 leather cover, and it was generally fine.  But I eventually decided that I'd like a cover/case that completely encloses and cushions the Kindle, as I tend to carry it around a lot, toss it in the car during trips, etc.  So I bought the Belkin Neoprene Sleeve Case after seeing and reading about it on Amazon.  And, happily, it turned out to be a great purchase, handsome and functional.  I especially like the way the cushioning inside isolates the Kindle from the zipper, so there's no danger (unless you're really, really careless, or maybe drunk) of scratching your Kindle while zipping or unzipping the case.And even though this is a soft product, there's just enough stiffness to the Belkin Case to prevent the material from settling down and sitting on the Kindle screen when you place the covered device down somewhere.  Though there's really no harm if that does occur, as the Kindle sits snugly in the case and won't move around and create friction between the inside surface and the screen.So, yeah, this is a very nice product, and it's economically priced, to boot.  Why not five stars, then?  Well, unlike the stiff official K2 cover, this is still a soft case that won't allow you to safely place anything of weight on top of it, so the Kindle will always have to be on top of any pile of things you're carrying or placing in a carry-all bag.  And I always have to take the extra, perhaps slightly inconvenient, step of making sure my grip is pressuring the keyboard area, not the more sensitive screen area, when I'm carrying the case around.  But these are quibbles.  There's yet to be a Kindle case or cover that perfectly addresses all concerns, and maybe it's not realistic to expect one.So, for now, if you're looking for a cushioned case that completely protects the Kindle from weather, scratches, minor bumps, and other things along these lines, you can't go wrong with the Belkin Case.",4,1
"It's been a while since I've read the Wizard of Oz, and decided it was about time I read it again! I totally remember when I was little reading it!!! I get different ideas and views from it now as an adult! So good my kids are going to read it!",5,1

"This review is split into two sections. The first section has to do with the subject matter and how it is presented. The second has to do with how it was formatted for Kindle.Part 1I picked this up for my Kindle because I teach The True Story of Hansel and Gretel. The main characters in the book flee from the Bialystok ghetto, and it is difficult to find detailed infromation.Midler's story almost seems designed as if it was something he told and then typed, which is possible because he did present to a class in CA. This makes the style at times slightly disconcerting, especially towards the end of the book. Midler chronicles his life during the war, as the only member of his immediate family to survive as well as his experiences during the birth of Isreal, his travels to the United States, and his return to Europe. The book not only allows the reader a view into not only the war but into the current situtation in the Middle East. Not only that, but Midler ties the events into current events.Part 2However, the reason why I gave it three stars instead of the four it deserves is that the Kindle edition is very badly formatted. There repeatitive FFFFFFFF (multiple letters), huge chunks of paragraphs are repeated and chapter headings sometimes appear in the middle of sentences. This doesn't happen on every page, but it happens enough to be very, very annoying. The formatting lets down the importance of the story, for this is something that should be read and should be used in schools.",3,1
"I agree 100% with the other reviewers that this story had WAY too many details, to the point of just dumb. We don't need to know that the character opened the door with his left hand by turning the knob to the right and then closing the door behind him by using the handle to push it closed. And the use of ""and then"", ""and then"", ""and then"" all the way through became quite tedious. I was really hoping for a strong ghost story in a short story but ended up being bored. Plus it needed a little editing. Glad this was free!",1,0

"I read this entire series and really enjoyed them. This last book was better than I thought, based on the reviews I read. Wasn't really necessary to go along with the rest of the series, but I enjoyed it and usually, I like to read all the books in a grouping. I read books so fast that sometimes by the time I write a review I need to go back and jog my memory. This is definitely worth the read and especially if you have read the rest. I cant say its the best of the bunch, but try it.",4,1

"This book is almost useless.  It does not even attempt to give the most useful phrases, and is in some cases misleading.  I see that those familiar with languages have uniformly the same complaints as I.  For example, the Turkish section does not even use the Turkish characters, meaning that the pronunciations will be wrong.There are a number of online translators and travel sites that would be much more helpful.I think this is overpriced when offered for ""free"", since it is a waste of time and effort.",1,0

This was an interesting turn to the classic vampire story.  I liked that the vampire was a good guy and that he proved to be better than the humans who had trained the hunter.  Good read.  Two thumbs up.,4,1
i was a little hesitant about this book. turns out this was a great book. i already ordered the next book. i love the characters and how this book keeps you guessing. would definitely recommend this book to others,5,1
"I enjoyed this book for what it was. I liked that it was a Christian novel although the characters beliefs played more of a background position. It was clear that their beliefs did not seem to influence their actions or thought processes outside of routine (bed time prayer and saying grace). I think too much time was wasted on events that didn't have anything to do with the main character and her lingering issues.I had issues with the main character in that she spent too much time with the married couple, and too much time with (too many) single men. Anyone whose ever read any Christian Singles books knows that those are 2 things singles are encouraged not to do. And although she had a likable personality, she was really one demensional. She only had one real main focus (finding a man) and seemingly no interest in anything else. It was almost like she couldn't be a whole person until she got married. Her only passion was to get married and have a family...no plans or passions beyond that.I also thought the flaskbacks were random and didn't add any significant details to the development of the story or the characters. And the ending was a big let down, there was very little insight given about her future husband whom she only talked to on random and emotional occassions throughout the book. Too much time was spent on her male best friend who could have been cut out early on in the book. The male best friend was a driving force throught the story yet there's no mention of him at the end of the book. Did he attend the wedding? did he hear? was he invited? so suddenly he wasn't important.",2,0
Just okay. Not the same tension and heat as the other books. Still a great series and worth picking up.,3,1
"Gandhi's story was a bit long-winded, and he talked so self-righteously about himself at times to the point of annoying-ness...some things he talked about (i.e. his diet) I found quite irrelevant. It was interesting to read that he was married at a very young age - I never knew that, and the complexities of that marriage made him seem more real. There were points where I almost felt he looked down on black South Africans, like it was wrong for white South-Africans to treat Indians poorly, but a totally different story all together with how they treated Black people (i.e. one night he was taking a walk down a South African road and was berated by a white man. One of Gandhi's white friends caught this and got mad at the white man for berating Gandhi. Gandhi said something to the effect of 'Oh forgive him, he just thought I was a black man') - this is paraphrased, but you get the just of it.Still, his determination and fight for Indians to be treated equally was inspirational. His peaceful protests are what eventually inspired Martin Luther King and, to a point, Nelson Mandela, fight for the rights of blacks in America (King) and South Africa (Mandela). So for that, and for refusing to accept the racist status quo for his people, Gandhi was an inspiration.",3,1
An enjoyable read. I bought into the setting and had a thoroughly good time with this book.,3,1

"Psycops is one of my favorite urban fantasies and Secrets is my favorite in the series thus far. Jordan Castillo Price has created a fun world, with interesting mysteries and with funny (yes, here is that word again) and sexy characters. Despite being urban fantasy, the characters and the setting are written in very a realistic manner and despite having a romance storyline throughout the books and the series, the romance does not overwhelm the storyline.The setting is Chicago and unlike another of my favorite urban fantasy authors that sets his books in Chicago, Jordan Castillo Price gets Chicago right. Throughout the Psycops series there are 4 key characters. Vic is the main character who is police officer. He is extremely insecure, socially awkward, completely jealous of his boyfriend's former lover yet still very endearing. Vic has an absent partner, Lisa - a very funny and loving person. Then we have Jacob, Vic's serious boyfriend and Jacob's partner Carolyn. Now comes the urban fantasy part of the series - Vic, Lisa and Carolyn each possess different psychic skills and as a result, are employed by police departments to assist in solving crimes. Jacob is not psychically talented but he is very much interested in people who are. Much of the series centers on Vic dealing with his ""talent"", which is seeing and communicating with ghosts, using his talent to solve a crime and the interplay of Vic's relationship with Jacob.The strength of the series to me is the incredibly complex characters Ms. Price writes, along with witty humor. When I am reading any one book in this series I am literally laughing out loud and marking excerpt after excerpt. I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves urban fantasy, mysteries or just self-effacing humor. Below are some excerpts from Secrets I particularly liked:(Vic commenting on the new home that he and his boyfriend moved in to and of which he spent the recent few days attempting to organize - unsuccessfully): ""When I got home from work, the cannery looked like an actual dwelling instead of a warehouse that'd been organized by a nearsighted drunk.""""A flicker of actual interest registered in the receptionist's eyes.  `Third floor, Detective.'  And if she noticed that Lisa was dressed in a mishmash of men's sweats, she didn't so much as blink over it.""""the longer I sat there, the closer I was to trying another sip of that decaf coffee.  I stood up and wondered if I was supposed to walk around and pull Lisa's chair out for her, but she was on her feet and bussing her own tray before I even had my own chair pushed in.""""I looked at Jacob.  He was watching me.  Still smiling.  I did my best to telepathically scream, `What the hell?' I don't think he received it.""""How could he do this to us? To me.  To either of us.  We were all in on it, all four of us.  Lisa might survive women's prison if she joined a Mexican gang.  Carolyn wou8ld probably be a smear on the wall within the first week.  I could squeak by if I was still good at being invisible.  But Jacob would be a big trophy kill, shanked by some tough guy looking to prove himself, probably beaten and tortured first.  Jesus Christ.""""We walked more slowly carrying our steaming hot cups of coffee with their helpful warnings printed on the side.""Warning:  The book contains explicit m/m sexual scenes.",5,1
"Not sure about this one....YES the scenes jumped around too much and I'm not an editing freak but it gets real annoying when the paragraphs jump around and the characters name changes on one line but than back to the correct name, I know I shouldn't do this but I skipped some chapters because of it.Once I started reading this story it did not draw me in but I muddled thru most of it....yes, the characters are black but you know that within the first chapter, that did not bother me but the massive typos/scene jumping did!Last...I hate when someone uses the &#34;CU**&#34; word..it totally turns me off. The sex scenes were also choppy. (Ex: Marcus woke up with Karyn in his arms...Karyn wakes up and smiles at Malcolm.) See totally confusing.",2,0

"To be honest I'm not a big Star Wars fan. Of course I saw all 6 movies, but that's all regarding this topic. No books, short stories, nothing. But I must say this was very good and easy reading, I enjoyed whole 8 books in this series. I'm not going to write here about the story, I think the book description is enough to get a picture about this book.I was just a little bit lost when there was word about various species like houk, massassi (don't know the exact writing). Their description in the book was very brief, maybe if I would know more about SW I would be in better picture. But it's still 5 stars for me.",5,1

"It is either hit or miss with me for J.L. Langley and her/his books. But with ""His Convenient Husband,"" the author pulls off the time honored tradition in romance novels - a marriage of convenience - and does it with style. Because Micah and Tucker had a great backstory, the reader was rooting for them to get together from the beginning. Langley's secondary characters, even the 'bad guy,' felt natural to the plot line and gave the reader an overall explanation of why Tucker and Micah marry not for love but to keep their family's ranch. By the end of the book, you were hoping for more: more plot, more sex, more Tucker and Micah's love story...which is always a plus when reading a novella. This is a universe I could visit again. 4 stars for ""His Convenient Husband.""",4,1

"If you like BDSM, this is for you.  But for me, it didn't really deliver on romance at all.  The hero was too consumed with his own needs fhroughout most of the book.  The heroine was weak.  Neither character was well developed. He was not really alpha.  He didn't even really protect her from her parents or her enemies.  WEAK story.  WEAK character development.  But, lots of BDSM.  The author is definitely relying on this to sell her book.  Not enough story for me.  Especially since I just read a couple of truly five star stories by Pamela Clare.",2,0
"This book is wrong on so many levels and although I don't usually type spoilers I will for this one..Hope is the daughter of one of the scientists at the lab Wolfe is held at. Although he marks her, he refuses to mate her because of her age. The labs burn down and Wolfe is believed dead for  years. Hope is alone and unable to move on with another man because of the bond.Hope's evil mother apparently knows Wolfe survived because she has been sending him photos of Hope with other men. (Fake of course). Wolfe appears out of nowhere, captures Hope, and punishes her by teasing her with sex, and not allowing orgasms. Due to the mating heat she is apparently writhing in pain while he continues to try getting the answers he seeks.If you find nothing wrong with the above, it gets worse!First time for her and he sticks it in her ass.When he finally out of no where does a 180 and decides she is innocent, he doesn't want to to relieve her because he might be to rough and his animal is at the surface!? What?!Of course she begs, they have their orgasms, and all is forgiven. There's some joking. And then her mother shows up for a quick (falling sandbags of all things) take down.This is a joke, the writing is just (not even good ) sex with some attempts at a story thrown in.",1,0
The story was pretty boring and I found myself skimming pages. The main girl really drove me nuts... she was over the top stubborn and just rude at times. This is not an erotica book if that's what you're looking for. Quick Read (like 2 hours tops)really should only be .99 book.,1,0
I really do not like to give bad reviews but this whole short story  collection honestly seemed to me to have no stories of redeeming value. I am a lover of and  collector of short story anthologies. Having hundreds in my library I  consider myself an amateur critic. It literally pains me to find not one story in this volume I could say was worthy.The stories seemed rushed as if the author was was late for her deadline.  Even the stories that had promise petered out leaving me feeling  cheated for lack of a better word.The sneak peek story at the end from the authors next book was the best story by farBut again I am deeply saddened and disheartened that I won't be buying that anthology.,1,0
"The story has a lot of potential, one that made me immediately go searching for the series to consider purchasing.  I wanted the cliff hanger to be solved, but the series that follows does nothing for it.  Worse, the author hopes that we will be drawn to the series enough to pay over $9 for it.  The problem I have with this is the book was good, but not that good.  I worry that I will be let down if I were to spend that much.",3,1

"This book was not a blockbuster but I enjoyed it. I will admit I was concerned when I saw it was free but that also left me with nothing to lose. He kind of lost me with the whole group of 200 survivalist people that basically ran as an army that also happened to have a mine as a base camp in Chicago. Then the whole spaceship thing threw me off too. Like I said I enjoyed the book but it made me shake my head occasionally when he went way out and threw things in that would not be possible. I enjoy Sci-Fi, I enjoy post apocalyptic, I enjoy military thrillers but this was too much to throw in one story line. I like to lose myself in a book and I did in this one so that is why I still give it three stars even with all the above being said.",3,1

"Beauty's Beast became a callous, unloving fop when he lost his beast form, and Beauty sets out on a quest to turn him back into the Beast she loved.While the story idea itself wasn't bad, the execution was awful.

I was mildly surprised to see the cast of  the Fey in this series.  Maybe I should have guesses by the title that it was going to leave me hanging.That's why the low rating.  If you don't mind waiting for the sequel, then it's an OK read.",2,0
"I liked the idea of a short erotic read and found this Elloras Cave book available free on my Kindle, so I downloaded it and commenced to reading.Ouch, this is bad. There is no goal in this book. A scientist is looking for a way to harnass sexual energy.

"While this was a quick overview of the Oldest City in the United States, founded September 8, 1565, I questioned that so many historical events happened in the remainder of that year alone. That aside, the book was a nice overview of St. Augustine.As a native and lifelong resident, I'm well versed in the history of St. Augustine having my own library dedicated only to the city, so I do not make this statement lightly.Yes, St. Augustine is beautiful and many times it's said that it looks more European than anything else except, of course, Disney World.  People tend to visit Orlando, then come to St. Augustine with visions of the 'magical' world and unfortunately think Castillo de San Marcos was a replica of 'a castle' built only for their enjoyment.  (It was built 1672-1695.)St. Augustine is a living, thriving city with all kinds of vehicles, tour busses, cars, trucks, RV's, everything imaginable, so obey the laws just like you would in your own hometown, such as crossing at crosswalks, looking both ways before crossing. The usual.  Park at the VIC with convenient and reasonable price and walk, not driving by and just looking.  In the most congested area of the city, the downtown area where many sites are located, there are homes where real people live, and businesses, all real, not posing for 'color.'Locals, including tour guides, are gracious, welcoming and courteous just because that's who we are.  Come and admire all the lovely architecture, the Plaza, the Oldest House and of course, Castillo de San Marcos.The sketches in the book add to the word whimsy in the title, but come see for yourself and get the timelines, 'up close and personal.'  The red carpet has been out for visitors for hundreds of years.",3,1
Good read. This was a good book. I enjoyed the fact that the author brought in a new look with a unexpected &#34;sleuth&#34; to work the crime. I was glad to see the &#34;love interest&#34; was someone he was able to re-connect with.,4,1
"The thing I loved about this book is the moment the hero because attracted to the heroine.  He did not come over to her because he was coming on to her. He came over because she looked sad and he is a nice guy. He becomes massively attracted to her the moment he notices her attraction to him. Its hot and its truthful. I loved it.This book has a lot of good stuff in it. The hero is the number one. I am sadly less interested in the heroine just because she sees the hero as a ""bad boy"" when we and she has no support for this idea except for his tats and piercings.  However, the writer doesn't give us much else.If this book was a fully developed romance, it would have been great. As it is, its good. I will check out the rest of the series.",3,1
"This story has all the elements that would make it one of the sexiest stories that I have read, but, it was just too short.  The length of the story does not allow the reader to become invested in the characters.  Bailey is a beautiful person.  She's a divorced, full-figured woman who owns a bakery and who is discovering her submissive nature.  She frequents a sex club where she feels alive and free.  One day while she is shopping she sees a guy she's noticed at the club, Aidn.  He's hot and a well-known Dom.  Their attraction for each other is mutual and explosive. The two get together at her place in one of the hottest scenes that I've read in a while.  Aidn wants her but he is reluctant because of a failed Dom/Sub relationship that he had and pulls away from Bailey.  When Bailey and a friend go to the club so that Bailey can take her mind off of Aidn, something happens that forces Aidn to admit that Bailey is the woman for him.  There could have been so much more to make this story a very memorable one.  I would like to see this story redone and made into a full length novel.  The heat is definitely there, the love scenes are exciting and sexy.  The potential for backstory and more insight into the other characters was left unexplored.  Overall, the story, for a short one was good, but I was left wanting more.  I will still check out more titles from Lissa Matthews because she really can write the sexiest love scenes, but the story did not come together as a love story for me.  The stories that I reread and that I remember are ones where the characters fall in love as well as lust and declare the emotion to each other.  This is missing from this story and possibly could have been its' saving grace.  The best icing comes WITH cake!",3,1

"Even though this book was free I had some reservations.  Based on the majority of reviews I went ahead and downloaded the book.  The writing was sophomoric and the plot so poorly executed that I ended up skimming the book rather than reading it so that I could say that I finished.  The romance made no sense.  Carly, the bar owner, was dead set against dating military, barely new Trey or Jake, then all of a sudden after spending roughly two days together on a mission (that conveniently only Carly could assist with) Trey and Carly are passionatly in love.  Jake who has been trying to get in Carly's pants for two years all of a sudden is happy for them both. If you took the sex out... I would have believed that it was written by a 12th grader.",1,0

"I was hooked from the very first page.  I had no idea what was going on and had to keep reading to find out what was happening.  Isn't that the point of a good read?  I wish that the storyline had been expanded more especially regarding the lead-up to the sting as well as the separation period.

"While the story has promise it was a difficult read.  The author needs to work on the craft of writing. Many rookie grammar, spelling and storytelling mistakes were distracting.  While in some cases the characters were hundreds of years old they didn't seem to have evolved beyond the consciousness of high schoolers.  Characterizations were also a bit inconsistent.  Political intrigue is not very sophisticated and the ways characters stow away and otherwise sneak around to avoid detection stretches credulity.  I also didn't appreciate descriptions such as ""The Latina woman"", ""the Asian"", or ""the dark man"" to describe every character who wasn't White.  In the meantime, what I assume are white characters had not such descriptions.  I appreciate the attempt but the author needs training.",1,0

"When i bought the book i expected it to be a short HOT read, what i got was a little different.  The novella turned out to be less erotica and more of a romance story.  It was entertaining and a good read.Kaya is a shape-shifter(Cougar), for her whole life she has been mostly in animal form not changing to human too often because she doesnt know how to fit into society or live as a human.Hunter and Jericho are hunters, they travel to Africa(and the like) to help a medical team get into tribes to provide aid.  In between assignments they live in a remote cabin waiting for the next call, during the time they stay there they see a cougar, one theyve come to call their pet.Kaya, Hunter and Jericho create a romance that is unique, when the men leave on a call its supposed to be only for a few weeks at the most, but things go wrong and the men get hurt leaving a pregnant Kaya to defend for herself thinking she was abandoned.My Opinion: The story was touching to read and well written, surprisingly the 3way relationship wasnt an issue it was just another part to the story.",5,1
"Belle Taylor has spent the last year working eighty hour weeks without a single day off.  It is now Christmas time and by God, she is going to visit her family for a week.  She wants that corner office in the law firm in which she works but also wants to spend time with her family.  When Rafe, her brother's best friend and the object of her late night fantasies since high school, kisses her under the mistletoe hanging in his hallway, Belle realizes that what she used to think was important, just might not be any longer.Rafe Bettencourt has been in love with Belle since she graduated from law school.  Finding himself in love with his best friend's baby sister is tough enough but Rafe has to compete with the lists and goals that Belle obsessively makes for herself.  He needs to convince her that life with him would be way better than any list she could ever make.To Do List was a new and fully anticipated experience for me. Lauren Dane is one of my favorite authors and I think this was the first totally contemporary romance that I have read written by her.  To Do List made me giggle simply because I COULD HAVE BEEN Belle.  Famous in my family for my lists, I so empathized with her need to be organized and loved how her quirkiness endeared her to Rafe. I simply loved Rafe because he loved Belle.  His patience with her, even when he was dying for her to come to grips with their relationship, was appealing to me and I just simply desired him for my very own.Readers used to reading Lauren Dane's outstanding fantasy and shape shifter novels need to give To Do List a try.  I wholeheartedly adored it.Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",5,1

"Out of Bounds was a quick, fun read. Kasey Johnson is a professional basketball player, and his twin, Garrett, is a famous Hollywood actor. Both are gay, Garrett is out but Kasey isn't. As the story opens, Kasey is back from an out-of-town game, and Garrett wants him to go out to a local club with him - Garrett has just broken up with his long-term partner and wants to go have fun.Ingram (Gram) Fletcher owns the Liverpool, the club near Kasey's home. Gram has had his eye on Kasey forever, but doesn't know if Kasey is straight or gay so he hasn't made a move. When Garrett and Kasey get to the club, one of their friends casually mentions to Gram that Kasey's in the back of the club and hints that Kasey might not rebuff advances from Gram. Then Garrett hints at the same thing. Deciding to take a chance, he heads over to see Kasey, and makes his move...and is rewarded with an enthusiastic response from Kasey.Kasey and Gram decide to get together again, and begin dating. Since Kasey is ""in"" and Gram is ""out"", it does make things a bit difficult. Kasey can't afford a hint of of the truth getting out as the sports world is nowhere near as accepting as Hollywood is, and rumors already swirl about Kasey's sexuality due to his twin being openly gay.When Kasey and Grant get together for a weekend in New Orleans, things don't go as planned and Kasey has to take a stand...My thoughts: First of all, you know I'm a sucker for any book that takes place in part or whole in New Orleans :) I really did enjoy Out of Bounds though. Kasey was a sympathetic character (I seem to always sympathize with the ones in the closet, I guess, lol) and Gram was understanding of his situation. I find in a lot of the M/M stories the partner that is openly gay gets frustrated with the partner that is not; that Gram wasn't pushing Kasey was a refreshing change.I had a bit of trouble with the opening scene - Kasey is very closeted and when Gram approached him in the club they started making out in public. I found that hard to believe, even if they were in the back of the VIP area. Except for that scene, though, I thought TA Chase did a great job with describing the setting and characters, and I could picture the events unfolding in my mind as I read along. Kasey's homophobic teammates were hateful and I was glad he also had supportive teammates in the locker room.I'm looking forward to reading his brother Garrett's story next - High Line.",3,1
"This is the first book I've read by Cooper Davis, and it seemed...fine. I know that's not a rousing endorsement, but in this genre, it actually kind of is. I liked the two characters, Max and Hunter. They were sweet and fun. The story was another ""straight guy goes gay"" story. Those can be fun, but often feel very contrived to me. This one was fairly light on plot, too. There was a lot of exploration of, primarily, Hunter's feelings and fears, but no real conflict. It was also kind of sweet that Max could read Hunter so well, but at times it seemed almost intrusively psychic when he'd take one look at Hunter and say something extremely specific that exactly addressed whatever bit of angst Hunter was feeling at the moment. I think the thing that was the most distracting for me was that the book was written in the present tense. That's really unusual and pulled me out of the story once in a while.Wow, all that sounds like I didn't like this book. I did. It was fun and light. The sex scenes were nicely done, too. And it was perfect for a quick summer read.",3,1

"The inspiration for this book was sweet, however, by the second half of the book, it was unclear if the story was about the experience of Jack's near boat catastrophe or about the lost opportunity for love.  The tone of the writing sharply changed also, to the point that it would be believable that someone else wrote the last half.  The ending was sweet, yet predictable.  The story could have used some more background on the marital relationship of the main character and the children's relationship with their father.  They seemed too accepting of Jack.  Would have expected some resentment from the eldest daughter who had been named after her mom's true love.",2,0

"This book is, as we say in the south, a hot mess.  The ideas in it have potential but they are never fully realized.  Most of the characters are flat, not fleshed out, and I had a hard time giving a damn either way about them.  The book is 90% dialogue with little or no real narration on things.  (What kind of dog is Spike?)  Katherine is a sniveling mess a good deal of the time.  Parts of it are just sex scene after sex scene (Which is better written than most Laurel K Hamilton sex scenes, so at least that's a bonus.).

I am pretty much all over the board with the stuff I read, so it kept me engrossed.  I just had to keep reading to see what trouble was ahead and how Alex and Joshua got through it.  Here was a book where the heroine had a level (as level as it could be...I mean this is a book about werewolves)head on her shoulders and she wasn't portrayed as being completely helpless.  It was kind of nice to read a story about a perfectly competent girl.  Between getting life changing news, finding her way to NC/safety with a guy she hardly knew but wanted to get to know, and being accepted into the pack, the drama in this book was never ending.

"Nothing provocative or life-changing. In fact, it seems the authors of the Didache simply cut and paste snippets taken from the New Testament and pasted them into this collection of customs, rules, and regulations. Perhaps this was intentionally done since most of the early church didn't have the full canon of Scripture in their possession at this time (2nd century AD). Nevertheless, I am glad I read this historical document that the early church utilized. A document that gave me a brief glimpse into how the early church operated and worshipped during a time of great persecution and upheaval.",3,1
"These books are all about the same.  Many were produced in the early years of the 1900's, and paint a picture of lives as slaves.  They were recorded before the people who actually lived this life passed away.  So they are snapshots of an historical way of life, which was varied, as there were &#34;good&#34; masters, and &#34;bad&#34; masters.  The level of education of various slaves is apparent.  Some were quite illiterate, and simple, while some were relatively sophisticated, depending on what the masters encouraged.",3,1
"I will read almost anything.  I like romance, erotica, thrillers, humor.  This book wants to be erotic but really it's just sex and the sex isn't that interesting after awhile.  There is no character development, the plot is more than simplistic.Basically, the guy goes into the Tyger version of a heat.  He needs sex and he needs it now.  The spacecraft needs him to pilot so they ask for a volunteer.  A female Tyger from his planet volunteers.So they have sex, domineering sex that gets old after the first two times. He treats her like convenience.  She resents him but wants him. And could the character please stop saying the word pussy. The pun was old after the first 10 times.  The guy gets well enough to pilot, his heat ends, he dumps her, she is broken-hearted.He ends up missing her after all and decides to take her back.  She says yes. The end.Really.  No plot.No depth of character.The male character is unlikable.So that's what I have to say.  This one is a not worth the three dollars.If you like these types of books, read Lora Leigh's Mercury's War, Megan's Mark, Dawn's Reckoning.  Those three are much better than this one.

"Contains some spoilers...This story rates between a 1 and a 1.5. It was very unique...but in an peculiar way. It was kind of like Twilight meets I Am Legend.If you do not like the YA genre, then this is not the book for you. With that said, I am not a fan of the YA so I struggled reading this book. The premise of the story seems a bit too immature for an adult audience. Starla and her friend Jordan become vampires so that they can be wealthy and glamorous but the story opens with the two friends standing outside of Jordan former childhood home; now kicked out and homeless because of her new vampiric state. The two Blood Sisters resign themselves to their new status and go looking for their first ""meal"" as vampires. They stumble upon a house with a former classmate who was reviled by Jordan because he used her sexually and then threw her away. A midnight snack and revenge at the same time...two birds, one stone. Perfect, right? Wrong, the girls' effort is thwarted by a usurper. He stole their meal and drained their first meal dry...taking away the opportunity for a meal and revenge. Darn!Poor girls...now, what are they gonna do, it's not like they can pick up blood in aisle thirteen at their local grocer. Nope, they have to figure out another food source. They continue their hunting and wind up at a local nightclub. They target a young girl, a doppelg&auml;nger for Starla according to Jordan, as their victim. The girls have their first food fight, literally, as the battle over who will win the quarry. Their first attempt of food acquiry ends in an epic failure. Their young victim escapes them while they are fighting each other over who gets to draw first blood. Starla's ""twin"" runs back into the club shrieking and the girls end up hungry...still.Pitiful humans turned into pathetic vampires...not a pretty picture at all. After their failed attempt to secure food, the girls find themselves at the playground where they were turned into vampires. Their arrival at the playground commences a sequence of events that change their vampiric lives forever.I say that this book reminds me of I am Legend because the vampires were described as completely hairless (even the females) with a gray skintone.The story struck me as disjointed. I could see where the pieces were supposed to connect but they were done so haphazardly. It was as if puzzle pieces of the story were dumped on the floor and the reader had to put the picture together. Mystery or suspense novel provide the reader with pieces or clues so that they can put together the final picture to figure outwho done it, why'd they do it, or what happened. However, since this book fit into neither genre it was not a particularly enjoyable experience piecing together the why's and what's of the story.The characters were just too juvenille to have broader appeal to an adult audience. The primary character ages were about sixteen or seventeen. Starla and Jordan were very scatterbrained (per impulsive descision to become a vampire without thinking through the ramifications); shallow (Starla vandalized and robbed a store to get a leather coat, boots, and sunglasses); and whiny (Starla didn't want to drink blood which made her weak...human...but raged and moaned when someone refered to her as such). Such a spastic trichotomy.Then there was the whole storyline of Mercer's grandfather being able to purify Starla's blood since she hadn't drank human blood. They were going to perform a dialysis of sorts and remove her blood, purify it, and put it back into her body and voila the vampire demon would be excised from her body turning her into a half-human, like Mercer. Dialysis...hmmm...really?!?! The description of the entire process was just too pedestrian. The story definately could have been made more if that storyline and process had been fleshed out a bit more.My feelings on the book are neutral; I did not totally hate it but, most likely, will not read it again. The book began with automatic strike for me because it was a YA which I do not typically read. However, in spite of my non-YA book policy, I have read one or two others and actually enjoyed them because they appealed to me on an intellectual level. The stories were mature in a way that elminiated the teen fiction novel feel. Unfortunately, this book was just too teenyboppery for me to really enjoy.",1,0
"I really enjoyed how this story developed.  Its a well-written Sci-fi depicting what happens when an alien race quietly tries to study earth and one of the members of the scientific team gets away from the group and is discovered by a human.  The world-building of the alien race was easy to follow since explanations came steadily throughout the story instead of one long monologue at the beginning.The characters' personalities and situations were established for some time before they actually come in contact with each other and then their relationship developed at a believable rate as they first had the culture/language barrier and then that period of just exploring their differences and similarities before it grew into something of a romantic nature.Not to say physical attraction wasn't there pretty soon after they met though Kent is a bear about it because he's recently sworn off women and here at his campsite remote from civilization he is joined by a female.Kent is a biology professor and scientist who was very athletic and rugged liking to bike and camp out far off the beaten path.  He is startled by Povre's differences when he first sees them, but soon adjusts to appreciating her exotic beauty and her sweet curious spirit.  Povre is of a race that has some psychic ability and she senses many things in Kent's emotions.  At first his anger frightens her, but then he becomes protective and kind.After getting over their mutual surprise, the rest of the story's action is about dogging all the government and non-government groups interested in capturing Povre for their own obvious reasons.  And at the same time, they grow closer knowing that Povre's people will probably come for her and they will be separated and there is always the fear that she'll be discovered and captured.From time to time, the story shifts to a third character, Povre's mission leader and father who was forced to leave her behind when she wandered away from their exploration group.  He follows protocol and gets the others back to their ship and safety even while despairing over his daughter's absence.  He knows that if she is captured, she will not be treated well.The plot held no surprises for me and it was simplistic, but that was fine with me because it allowed me to focus on the developing romance between Kent and Povre.  They really were good together.  He was trustworthy and strong for her while at the same time he was tender and understanding of what she was going through.  Povre helped heal Kent's bruised heart, gave him someone to protect and love as well as showed him the delights of discovering something for the first time when he watched Povre enjoy nature.  What I really thought was interesting is that though both are humanoid and share enough characteristics to be compatible, this truly is an alien romance.  They really saw each other's souls under all the surface differences.It was a nice read and I recommend it to anyone who wants to read a light Sci-Fi Romance.",4,1
"I see from the previous one star reveiws that they  did not buy the book(lucky them).  For some reason I bought it, I am not going to give you a blow by blow when it was already described in the two star reveiw but I will add my two cents about format of the book, it was terrible. I will not buy anything of her again!! But I will add that who ever formatted the book should lose there job and the auther needs to go to writing class to. Her flow  was off and the way she wrote was like a child. And she seemed obsessed with pricey things(she decribed them at length). If anything if she want to keep writting she at least needs a better editer.",1,0
"I think this is the best Freya North book I've read so far.  I couldn't put it down for the first half.  The heroine was an attractive character and though I couldn't really identify with her seeming lack of basic common sense in some areas, North's manages to hook you and get you invested in her happy ending.  The Hero, Joe, however was the most interesting.  His journey from being the aloof commitment-phobe ""player"" to faithful one-girl-guy was very well done.  There were moments which bothered me but which were ultimately realistic (SPOILER ALERT:  I'm referring to his continuing with Nathalie even though he'd already begun something with Tess.  END SPOILER ALERT) and made the book that much more interesting.  The whole thing is very satisfying and this is one of the best contemporary romances/chick-lit books I've read in a while.  Though I loved it and couldn't put it down, I have to admit that most people would probably find the second half a bit too long.  There was a bit too much emphasis on the bridge metaphor (Joe builds bridges for a living) and there was a bit too much repetition which should have been better edited.  That said, this is one of Freya North's best books.  Loved it!",4,1
"I guess this book is considered erotica.  But it is erotica only in the sense that most of the book is sex with very little plot.  There is a background story going on in between the sex scenes.

"Delia has a very distant relationship with her father, but that doesn't mean she isn't devastated when her childhood home, Steward House burns in a fire. Her father is left in a coma as a result. Not having much money, and knowing she will have substantial medical bills in the near future for her father, she decides to sell Steward House to Grant Wolverton. She has had a crush on Grant since childhood, but he doesn't remember her. Very wealthy, Grant who deals in antiques and art, offers to restore Steward House, and Delia reluctantly hands over the deed for a great sum of money.Delia herself is a stone conservator - but that is not where her special abilities end. She can also communicate with the stone statues. They keep her company but they have also made her the town outcast. Stories have been swirling about her odd behavior in the small town she is from. Now that she is back in that small town, gossip starts again. Afraid to let Steward House go completely, she offers to take over the remodel. Grant agrees - and neither can quite let go of the attraction that is building between them. But the question of who set the fire is still unsolved and there is another woman in town who has her eyes set on Steward House and Grant.Stone Kissed is an odd little book. I say that because it is different - and I really wanted to like it. But I had some problems. It starts off rough and the first third of the book I had a really hard time with. The sentences and changes from scene to scene were jerky and not smooth. I didn't understand Grant and had a hard time with the intense attraction Delia feels for him. About halfway through things start to settle down and I became more immersed in the story. It is a dark book. Delia has an awful relationship with her father who is now comatose so she has guilt in that area. She had to give up her home which she feels a great connection to, and she has to figure out these intense feelings for Grant. I had a hard time buying into the romance. The actual sex scenes are very sensual, but I didn't get Grant's love for Delia. Delia herself has had a crush on Grant for years, so her side makes more sense. But for most of the book, Grant thinks Delia is delusional for her claim to talk to statues and he thinks she is a thief for taking his statues from him. Yet he still falls in love? I buy into the fact he lusted after her and likes her in his bed, but not love.I liked the statue aspect and how they interacted with Delia. I also think the villain in this story is well done - nothing is held back in terms of the evil emanating from her. But the overall tone of the book is so dark and depressing. I tend to like darker books, but there wasn't anything to grasp onto as we waded through the serious stuff. I never quite understood Delia and Grant. And when I don't believe in the love between the hero and heroine, I can't be satisfied by the story.",2,0
"Two journalists - Joe Jonas and Abby Reno - are assigned to cover yet another crackpot conspiracy theorist with his own idea about the JFK assassination plot. However, there may be more than meets the eye this time. Now Jonas and Reno have to find the truth - against the wishes of their editors and other people who are trying to kill them to keep decades-old secrets dead and buried.Dave Conifer does an excellent job of explaining the major real-life players of the JFK scandal to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the intricate details (*raises hand*). Combining the pace of an action thriller with the backdrop of JFK, the author uses one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century to weave an intricate tale of historical fiction in ""Man of Steel.""",5,1

"This was a great follow up to King of Prey. The main character in this is the right hand man of the King of Hawks. Sachin meets his mate when she is to young to claim but he continues to visit her as she grows up. After mistakes are made and trust is lost Sachin must figure out what he wants and how to hang on to it.I liked how this book went with a different approach to how the main characters meet and their relationship progresses. There was no instant love with them flying off into the sunset. It was a more real love with a undeniable passion between the two that is common in the paranormal romances. I enjoyed following both characters and learning about them, their pasts and their futures.Again I love this series and so far out of all the books this one was my favorite. I definitely recommend this to fans of Paranormal Romance or shifter stories.*I received this book for free from the author in exchange for an honest review.*",5,1

"I read the first full book in Rachel Vincent's Soul Screamer's series before I ever got this on my Kindle for Blackberry application.  I have the second full book on my shelf ready to be read and I thought I would read this as a refresher first.  I enjoyed the quick story but it really is merely a teaser to the first book and I think that if I had missed out on this altogether it would have been no loss for me.  This sets up the story of Kaylee, a teenager who sometimes feels the urge to just scream.  These urges are brought on by a stranger and usually in a very public place.  One of these screaming fits takes place in the middle of a mall shopping trip with her best friend.  No one can ignore this one and it draws even more attention when Kaylee claws at her own throat.  This finds Kaylee locked up in a mental ward. Why is she here? What is really wrong with her?  Who is this mysterious girl, also a patient, who keeps staring at her?  The story read fast and Vincent is an enjoyable writer.  However, I have even read the first book (and enjoyed it)...I know Kaylee's big secret now, and I was still shockingly disappointed by the ending.  There is NO resolution at all.  Worse yet, I don't rememeber every finding out about the other girl in the ward....  Hopeful this gets brought up later down in the line of books, because its going to annoy me not knowing why the girl did what she did in the book and who she was.  Three stars because it was entertaining and I do enjoy the later books and its free.",3,1

"This was a pretty good, enjoyable introduction to the Werewolves of Malta series. We dived right in to the potential mating between Bruno and Renee. Bruno is an alpha who knows what he wants who recognizes the power that Renee holds. He knows that a mating between them could bring their Pack power but he has to challenge the current Pack leader. Renee has been burned by alphas before; her father is trying to sell her to an older mate so she's reluctant to believe that Bruno wants to become mates. There is an undeniable spark between them that draws them together and heat when they finally come together. I had only a few issues with this story. Again, I felt it was a little short; there was a lot of potential for a longer story. I also wasn't that big of a fan of the fact that Renee was only 20. Maybe it's because I'm getting older but I'm typically not drawn to heroines that are that young. Other than that, good read!",3,1

"At first glance, I almost dismissed Longclaws as a seen-it-before monster novel, derivative of that 1980's horror that filled my bookshelves long ago.  I was very wrong.Instead, with Longclaws, I was immediately swept into some darkly fabulous storytelling.  Instead of struggling to finish the book, I was thinking about the book when doing other things, anxious to return to my reading.Now, to be honest, there were a couple of minor technical issues.  Block paragraphs instead of indentations.  Occasional odd formatting glitches like errant commas inside of words.  And some transitions that weren't noted with extra paragraph spacing.  But I score very hard on formatting and I have to say that the errors were very minor.  The author's storytelling was on point and sharp enough that the formatting only bothered me a little.What stood out for me most in this book is the attention to detail paid to the monsters.  Usually, in monster horror, the monster is pretty one-dimensional.  Monsters fall into very few categories.  Critter gets revenge by killing and eating.  Critter just kills and eats for not much reason at all.  Critter gets a hold of something radioactive and kills and eats.  You know the drill.However, in Longclaws, the author has not only built an entire history and social structure for his critters, he skillfully weaves it into stories of human history and mythology.  As you read, you find that you are delighted as your mind starts making certain connections into our shared history.Peek brings you into the minds of his monsters and, the funny thing is, you start to wonder who the real monsters are.  You start, little by little, to feel for them in their world of predator vs. prey.From reading a bit about the author, it seems like this might have been one of those books written long ago, lingering in a dusty drawer (or computer file), that he brought out, dusted off, and decided to put it out there for publication.  I can only hope that he has a few more tales to dust off and put out there, because I want to see what else lurks in the darkness of his brain.",4,1

"This was actually an interesting book, filled with all sorts of adventure, violence, and intrigue.  I wasn't sure in the very beginning if this would be a book I would like, so I was surprised when I got drawn in.  An American, Eric, gets himself in a jam in Mexico and is forced to get involved in drug smuggling.  He uses his wits to stay alive and to eventually double cross his captors.  There were certainly some areas where I had to suspend reality, but I was willing to do so.The main characters were surprisingly well developed and there was certainly a new surprise around every corner.  Since I am not that well informed about the drug cartels in Mexico, I had to accept the things that happened in the book as being probable.  Based on what I do know, I suspect this was not too far off.The psychological effects of the whole experience on Eric are interesting just on their own.  How would a person react to such a circumstance?  It seems believable that he would go nearly crazy, having to be surrounded by so much violence, much of it of his own doing.Surprisingly good book.  I received a free copy in exchange for doing a review.",4,1

So they made out - then she moved out - without a word, no note - nothing.  Justin is giving up that easy, he wants Gabby - and he will do anything to convince her.  There is talk of domestic violence but, it only to develop the background plot - doesn't really play into the main story line.This is another story about how a friendship becomes more.

The print portion of articles is good, but the quality of the limited number of pictures or other rare graphics could be better.

"One of the things I liked about this story was how the heroine, Robyn, was deaf. She's feisty, spunky and a total alpha female. I even liked Keil, even though it was mentioned a lot that he was such a strong alpha but I never saw that. What I did see were sweet moments in which Robyn and Keil got to know each other and realized they have a lot in common.Pretty much the only thing wrong with this story was the length. I have a lot of questions about the pack and especially about what's going to happen to Robyn and Keil now. She obviously has to move to Alaska but does she want to? How with the pack accept her? Is she going to use her voice more? Is she going to get a new job?Anyway, I liked the story. It's quick and cute and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.",4,1

"I can't say I liked this one, just not the type of story I care to read. It was, in general, well written (save a few very odd metaphors), but I found it to be awkward. The two MCs don't have much depth and they sort of stumble together and they didn't have a connection that I saw, and they just.....are there.I also found some of the plot points odd. (Small Spoilers Follow): Brock, who is the down on his luck model, made a sex tape with his heiress-celebutant ex-girlfriend. This apparently ruins his career. Hmmm. That seems unlikely given that Kim Kardashian has made an entire career out of having a huge butt and a very well distributed sex tape (Thanks Mom!). So....I didn't get the big deal. The sex tape is described and it's not as though young children or sheep were involved so I'm just not seeing it.There is no HEA either, always a downer for me.Overall I just wasn't invested in the characters and I didn't buy the plot. It just wasn't for me.",2,0

What a terrific work of suspense blended with horror and cheese curds. Possibly the most attractive feature of Kilborne's prose is that its pictures are painted perfectly with just the right words. They are uniquely his and not a poor man's Stephen King like so many other horror writers I could name.Instead of rehashing the whole story from beginning to end and labelling it a review, I'll say this: I greatly enjoyed the characters, the suspense and the story.

"I picked this book up as a freebie and while I didn't hate it, I had some major issues with it. I would rate this book as 2.5 stars.The good: The main shifters aren't your typical wolf or some other popular animal. They are hawk owls so like raptors. It was interesting enough to keep me reading for a while. After a little bit, that interest wore off.The bad/ugly: The writing was amatuerish. A lot of telling rather than showing. ""Lana knew xxxxx"" and ""Dover understood xxx, because xxxx"".The thing that got on my nerves the most was the whole ""honor"" situation. That word and the concept displayed in the book hard to have easily taken up 40% of the story. ""You dishonor me by doing this"", ""you honor me so I will do this"" ""Lana questioned such and such's honor"". I mean it literally occurred over and over and over again.The take on the hiding of emotions was interesting. It could have been such a great premise if the story telling was written better (I'm thinking in the vein of Nalini Singh's Psy and the way they are written).All in all I didn't hate this book (otherwise it would have gotten one star). It was interesting to a point (abut 60%). After that I was like well I don't really care what happens to anyone in this book. The sex scenes were alright.",2,0

In what had been the vast Midwest, the Southwest, and Southeast, the land has been divided into territories ruled by the High Council of Shadowlords -- three powerful psychics from far beyond the Terran galaxy. Rogue reapers called Balgairs have been turned loose by the alien Ceannus to destroy the humans of Terra. To eradicate them before this happens, the High Council has brought in seven of Morrigunia's Reapers.Reapers are forces to be reckoned with. Tall,dark-haired, and inordinately handsome and well-built, these men each possess a symbiotic worm that gives them the strength of 10 normal men. Neither vampire nor werewolf, but a combination of both, they can shapeshift into both a wolf and a bird. Their senses are enhanced, and they have powers to mesmerize and do all manner of magical things. Tough, unsympathetic killers, they'll melt your heart with the loneliness and despair they hide from the world but cannot hide from the women destined to be their mates. Ultimately, they are the final word of law in the Territories, and nothing is more important to them than the protection of their people. Yet the people they've dedicated their lives to protecting fear these solitary blood-drinking Reapers nearly as much as they fear the blood-thirsty Rogues.In between assignments, Reaper Eanan Tohre has spent centuries as the Triune Goddess Morrigunia's plaything, the replacement for the man the Goddess really wanted as her consort, Eanan's twin brother Owen. When the Goddess took Owen off for the duration of his sentence in the Citadel's con cells for taking a mate and turning her into a Reaper without the Shadowlords' consent, she replaced him with Eanan.Once the sentence was served and Morrigunia no longer needed Eanan to suffice for his brother, Eanan was left as the Citadel to serve the Shadowlords. But he has another purpose. The Goddess has promised him to the Gatekeepers: Argent Ben-Alkazar, Corallin Tarnes, and Aureolin Belvoir. Virgins and sisters from the same mother, the three women want to experience the passion and companionship the Reaper wives and mates are enjoying. They each have their own sexual needs and desires, and it takes a versatile and experienced man like Eanan to complete them.When they summon him, he knows not why. Commanded to sit and be quiet in their presence, he wriggles around in discomfort under their sensual scrutiny, their lusty looks setting his black blood on fire. When they tell him to strip or be stripped, the wide-eyed Reaper has no choice but to do as he's ordered.Embrace the Wind differs from Charlotte Boyett-Compo's customary Reaper and rogue-filled cowpunk that makes the WesternWind series so unique and exciting. Though it's fast-paced and as well-written as any of her books, this short novella is missing the action I so love about this series, but it shows us the author's lighter side, with some good old-fashioned bedroom romps that are sexy, amusing, poignant, and yes...even sweet. Plus, it's fun to see the sisters dish out some comeuppance to their scowling, growling brothers, particularly the obnoxious Kheelan.I didn't like Eanan when he was first introduced in WesternWind 4: Tears of the Reaper. After all, even if you can overlook his slitting his brother's throat, there's the fact that he's been an irreverent cad ever since. But he grew on me as he began to redeem himself not only with Owen, but with the other Reapers and of course with the Shadowlords. He displays some heartfelt perceptiveness and concern in worrying whether Aureolin and Corallin would feel slighted when he choses Argent as his first wife. The budding love between Eanan and Argent is touching.Like all the books in the series, this book is best if read in sequential order, particularly since Eanan's story actually begins in book 4. -- This review belongs in its entirety to TwoLips Reviews, LLC.",4,1
This book was fine.  I read it in two days and kept my attention - lots of flinching moments and a bit weird in the end but overall it was good book if you like the subject matter.,3,1
"This is a very explicit story, which is fine. The problem I have with it is that although the main characters have a love story, their first encounters are uncomfortably close to rape. It's not what they do that makes the difference, it's the emotion, or rather the lack thereof. The bad editing is also not helpful.",3,1
"This is one of the best books I have read in a long, long time.  The snarkiness, the genuineness of the characters, the writing are all just plain wonderful.  She describes someone as looking like ""Ichabod Crane's ugly brother.""  Even writing that makes me laugh.  Read this book, you won't regret it.",5,1
This is a VERY short story with little plot or character development.  Same those few minutes it takes to read the entire story and purchase something you can enjoy.,1,0

A wonderful adventure described in great detail as only Jules Verne can do. Readers of all ages will greatly enjoy this book.,4,1
"Vengeance by A.J. Scudiere was one of two books I got from Scudiere's publisher for review.  I read Resonance first, and really enjoyed it.  I had saved Vengeance for last because it was written after Resonance and I didn't know if it was a follow-up with the same characters.  I quickly found out...  it's not.  It's *completely* different, and *really* good.  I had a harder time putting this one down than the first.  I'd have been perfectly happy had it gone even longer than its 400 pages.Lee Maxwell was an accountant with a nice happy family.  That is, until he discovered that he was working for a business run by the mafia.  His attempt to contact the authorities and leave his job only led to the gruesome death of his wife and daughter.  He went off the grid, buried his identity, and started working on getting revenge for the killings.  During one of his operations, he runs into another killer, ""Sin"", who is young, female, dressed in leather, and an expert in knives and slow, painful deaths.  It quickly becomes obvious that they have the same purpose in life...  revenge on the mafia and other assorted lowlifes who need to be stopped one way or another.  Owen Dunham, the FBI agent on the case, has to figure out who the ""Grudge Ninja"" is, and why ""he"" is killing all these people.  But should the truth be known, he'd rather allow the killings to continue, as it's a swift and deadly form of frontier justice.  Lee and Sin have to come to some sort of arrangement in order to stay out of each other's way and maximize their efforts.  Why should they both spend time researching the same target, only to find out the other one got there first for the kill?  But Sin has her own dark history that drives her revenge, and opening up to another person is not something she's able to do.  The revenge killings reach a crescendo as the FBI starts to get their first real evidence left behind at the scene.  The question becomes whether Lee and Sin will finish their list before the FBI (or the mafia) gets to them first...The story starts out from three very different perspectives, that of Sin, Lee, and Owen.  And it's not clear at first why Lee is gunning down scum, and why Sin is leaving dead bodies with multiple cuts and slices, complete with crime documentation, all wrapped up (literally) in a big red bow.  Dunham has his own issues, as he really wants to get out of the business and take time to enjoy his wife and daughter before she tires of his demanding job and leaves him.  But once Sin and Lee start to confront each other, the story and characters really start to jell.  Neither of them want to trust each other, but neither of them wants to eliminate the other, either.  This tentative truce gives way to the beginning of trust, all to seek vengeance against those who have destroyed their lives.  I was also quite satisfied with the ending, as I wasn't looking forward to how I *though* it was going to conclude.Very dark, plenty of action, and character interaction that was stellar...  An excellent read.",5,1
"This is Science Fiction Romance so we know the destination.  It is the journey that makes this such a good story.  There is enough action, adventure and romance to satisfy any SFR fan...Povre and Kent are bot great characters.",4,1
"(Originally posted on SnarkyMomReads)""FERAL DOMINATION"", by T. A. Day, is the first of (currently) four books of the Faldron Shifter series.  As of this writing, it is being offer as a freebie at Amazon.  Typically when I see something published by Ellora's Cave I jump on it; their writers are normally 'safe bets' and really - if it's free, what does it hurt to try out a new author?Um, famous last words.In the overall scheme of things, the storyline was very good & deserves about a 4.5 star rating.  Gionne and Jenna are childhood playmates that become sweethearts with plans to mate - even though he is lupine and she is feline.  (In other words - they want to see if cats & dogs CAN play well together...)  Due to his father's illness, Gionne pushes Jenna away and she is NOT understanding of this and turns her back on him.  Fast forward a few years and she is asked to be a ""guest"" at Gionne's compound while the lupines grant the felines some much needed land to hunt on.  This story has REALLY REALLY HOT sex scenes - menage & anal are some, so you are warned! - and lots of miscommunication due to some betrayals by one of the pack members.What this story doesn't have?  Descriptive communication.  At times I felt like I was reading stilted, Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator style dialogue.  It was driving me nuts.  (NOT - ""It was driving me nuts!"", she exclaimed emphatically.)  Like I said, though, this is the first of the series (published in 2009) and is over 300 pages.  I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that as the author got into the series, the dialogue flowed a bit more easily.Hey - it's a free trial right now.  Doesn't hurt to try, right?  And if you really like shifter romances - this could be the start of one of your favorite series!  YAY!",4,1
"I like Joe Hill's other books/stories and looked forward to this Kindle short-""My Father's Mask"". Wow, was I ever disappointed. If you want to read a story that seems to be the beginning of a book that is never solidified or brought to any semblance of a conclusion, then this one is for you. And I enjoy ""quirky"" stories, ones that don't give the reader the expected outcome (such as the O. Henry stories) but this is just wrong. It's as if the author is trying too hard to be ""deep"", but the storyline was too strange for me to enjoy.",2,0
"I enjoyed the premise of the story however the lack of editing prior to publication really detracted from what could've been a really cute tale.  There were problems with verb tense usage throughout.  A huge overuse of the word ""had"" really detracted from the storyline.",2,0
But at times the author couldn't' keep their own character's straight. Good thing it was a simple story without many characters.  Too easy to actually..,1,0
I read and enjoy Paranormal Fantasy/Romance. The heroine in this story is impossible to like. Rae in the words of another reviwer is &#34;selfish and immature&#34;. I agree! The story does not take me in another world. Perhaps the author tried to put to many story ideas into one book. It does not flow well. I will probably read the second book since they were free.,2,0
After reading all the glowing reviews about this book I bought it.  It sounded so wonderful & about all the things I like to read.  I was disappointed I'm sorry to say.  I found it slow going & a bit boring.  I finally did finish the book but personally for me it wasn't worth it.,1,0
"This short story about 2 serial killers is both shocking and horrific in a good way.  This quick read examines why no one should hitch or pick up hitchers.  Two authors contributed to this grizzly tell.  Jack Kilborn's character is Donaldson - he likes to rape, maim, kill, and then burn the evidence.  Blake Crouch's character is Lucy - she likes to drug and kill her victims.  One chapter is dedicated to introducing each serial killer.  Then the 2 authors shared chapter 3 & the worked together to battle of wills.  Overall is a quick, disturbing tell that is well-worth the read.  I have forwarded it on to several people who agreed with my recommendation.",4,1
"I've tried reading this book numerous times over the past couple of weeks but for some reason, I can't get into it. After reading a few other reviews I see I'm not alone in my thinking. Normally, I have to finish a book once I start it this book has made me change that personal policy. I got stuck at 40% and couldn't go on.As a fan of this time period and the Salem story in general, I find their beliefs interesting and amazing. Sorry to say, this book just didn't do anything for me.",2,0
I have to agree with the other reviewers; this book was perking along nicely and it just kinda stopped. I also really had to laugh at the fact that it supposedly takes place at a Tahoe campgound. They would have been kicked out after the first night for making too much noise!,3,1
"I was very wary of reading this book...as I had never read it before. It was a well written creative classic. He really sinks you into the depths of the earth with the charactors. There were times I would hold my breath and then think wait...I'm not down there. lolHe had to think a lot to write this book and how it would really be to go down in the earth.There are three men who climb down a dormit volcano and start a journey to find the center of the earth. What they experience and see when down in the depths is only as amazing as the imagination. The ""giants"" and sea creatures, the world underneath. And then return to the surface of the earth, a truly amazing journey",4,1
"Generally I'm one of those people who, when I start a book I read it all the way through. I couldn't with this one. The main character drove me crazy from the get go. She's not much younger than me but she acted like a teenager, I wondered if it hadn't been written by one. I admire people who write and put their work out there to the world, and I hate to say it really but I wouldn't waste the money on this. It's repetitive to the point of insanity. I'm sure the story line is fine, I think I would have enjoyed it had it not had the issues I just couldn't get past. I found myself skimming over it by chapter 5 and finally had to stop reading it altogether.",1,0
"This is a short, virtually plotless, tale.  It's hard to imagine a child young enough to find the text interesting would be okay with a story devoid of pictures.  Like at least one other reviewer, it makes you wonder who the target audience is for this story.",1,0
The relationship came together to quickly for me.  The story did not allow the two of them to really get to like each other before they were sleeping together.,3,1
"The flow of the story is broken by the extensive Old Testament quotations.  The story is otherwise a typical example of the &#34;bad man redeemed&#34; genre.  Biblical references were common in the era in which the story was set, but their use here is excessive.",2,0
"I downloaded this as a freebie, I would have been seething if I'd paid for it. Bad writing, no plot, ridiculous characters and cringeworthy dialogue all add up to a book you can well do without.",1,0
"Shifter romance.  Great book.  Very entertaining with good humour, strong plot and characters.  Lays a great foundation for the rest of the series.  Worth reading and having a good laugh while enjoying the interaction between characters.",4,1
I am re-doing an on stage production of Mark Twain and his writings. This year I was going to bring out some of his more critical views on organized religion. Captain Stormfield was just the beginning of my very convenient Kindle research.,5,1
"Ok I admit I need to pause a minute to write this review.  This is such a different plot line than other reads. This is most like Terminal Freeze by Lincoln Child.  The whole idea of a relic creature.  Just enough science to hold my interest, but both the characters and the story line could have been expanded on they where both a little light and not enough details.  I would enjoy reading additional stories by Dallas Tanner.",3,1
It is a very erotic book. I wasn't expecting it but was pleasantly surprised by th  storyline. Was it earth in the future I don't know. I wish they had more backstory on Caralon.,3,1
"Every day for four years, Jane Smith passes by an antiques shop on her way to work at the factory. Every year at Christmas time the owner displays a Christmas scene that features a miniature village called The Village of Peace. Jane pulls herself away from the window display and bumps into a man.Ron Morgan has just met the most beautiful woman in his life. Ron can't stop thinking about her and goes in search of Jane.Charlie Righton is the owner of the antiques shop. Jane comes in to get a better look of the Village of Peace. She is so disappointed when she learns that it is not for sale. Charlie tells Jane that miracles happen and that she should pray.I liked this book. I thought it was sweet and a quick read. The only issues I had with the book was that the first several pages was spent describing Jane's obsession with the Christmas display, which I didn't really understand until I got middle of the way. Also, I would have liked to get to know Jane and Ron better as they were suppose to fall in love but I didn't feel the connection. Overall, though I liked this book and thought it was magical Christmas fun.",3,1
I have read other books by this author but this one was quite easy to figure out. I did not like it,2,0
"Nice short story.  However, I found myself more focused on trying to figure out who Willy was, rather than the story line.  Is he a boy or an animal? A couple of times I reread the beginning pages trying to find out who he was.  It does not say until 70% into the story. He is in fact a duck.  The pictures started to give me a clue at some point.",2,0
"This reminded me of a cross between Dave Barry's Big Trouble and It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.  Don't be mistaken, Alan Hutcheson has his own brand of talent and shows it off in Boomerang.  This is a funny, convoluted tale of mystery and mayhem.  It's a mad dash to see who can get to the boomerang first.  Why?  The Boomerang contains detrimental CIA secrets.  I'll try to sum it up:  Ted is a jazz musician but his guitar, Sarah, is in the window of a pawn store. In order to get some cash to spring her Ted teams up with Jerry for an assignment from the AABC an unofficial branch of the government.  The assignment is to get the boomerang... but so many things can go wrong with such a simple assignment.  Things like a crazy pair of Australian sisters, an insane assassin who carries a crossbow, a cheerleader who rarely wears clothes, and a senator or two.  I strongly recommend you follow Ted and Jerry (I kept wanting to say Tom and Jerry!) on this adventure.  You will laugh the whole way.",4,1
"I enjoyed this read with its different characters and their plight.  It had mystery, erotic adventures and in the end love between the two.  I am looking forward to reading the next two in the series, which have completely different characters (shape-shifting type) to see what this Author is really capable of.  It was good enough for me to purchase the others.",4,1
It is hard for a book to be timeless and this one was definitely aged - Not as clever as it thought it was in these current times.,3,1
"Not for the faint of heart.  Severe, humiliating, sadistic and non-consensual futuristic (post-plague) society where women are bought and sold as nothing more than sexual objects is where we are introduced to Tria and her owner Thomas.  Tria is the second story written by Carolyn Faulkner along this same story line.  This story includes caning, spanking, bondage and also some enema play.  The first story in this series isPrimaand IMO is better written and has better editing.  Both stories are very brutal so buyer beware.",3,1
It was kind of obvious who did very early on in this book. Didn't hold much to keep the pages turning fast.,2,0
"There is nothing here that's remotely interesting beyond the travelogue of Australia. The author calls it a romantic comedy; for the life of me I could not find a single thing that was funny - only boring. The book seems like an attempt to preach some sort of message about love and relationships, but the the characters come across as two-dimensional, too serious, too predictable, too stilted, too artificial, too asexual, too pure. Honestly, if I ever met somebody like Drew I'd get as far away from him as fast as possible. He'd bore me to tears. She probably would too.",2,0
I love Brenda Jackson.  This was a great story or should I say stories.  Each story just got better and better.  It's great because you get to know all the characters and can feel like you are part of the family.  This was a great buy.  I recommend it to all adults.  So grab your copy and get started.,5,1
"I enjoyed this selection very much as I am a long-time fan of her work. However, I was shocked and diaappointed to discover two things: 1.The collection was not ordered in line with the various story arcs in her fiction, and 2. There were too many duplicates between the three collections I purchased at the same time! [Not a deal killer concidering the low cost of them overall!]",3,1
Writing a story about a curse that isn't in effect anymore is not a great idea. Good try though.,2,0
The book did not flow well. Slow getting to the point and the authors attempt to make the characters sound Scottish was terrible. Don't waste your money on this one.,1,0
"As I was reading this story, I was surprised to find that it was a take on the Legend of La Llorona.  I grew up in New Mexico and so am familiar with it.  She was never violent towards other people, except for her own children.  So it's hard for me to imagine the ghost killing so many people in such a violent manner.",3,1
"I enjoyed the first 1/3 of this book.  The story was engaging and I am always hopeful that I'll find a really great thriller in the same vein as Tom Clancy. (a person can dream, can't they?)I was especially pleased when an early scenario came to a satisfying, timely resolution.  I looked forward to enjoying the rest of a fast paced read.Sadly, this wasn't meant to be.  The last 2/3 of the book could have been told in half the time.  The story started to drag and meander.  The reader can see where the book is going, but it takes such a long, round-about way to get there that I found myself skimming trying to get to the inevitable conclusion.Two other negative points were: 1) It was difficult to get in the government's corner over the root issue.  Without giving anything away, I could definitely see the terrorist's point when it came to their outrage against the U.S.2) The suspense of this book took a hit when it became apparent that the only truly 'together' group in this tale was the mafia portion.  Neither the government agencies nor the terrorist group were very bright or formidable.  Some of the passages were truly cringe worthy.A HUGE turn off for me was the inclusion of a romantic twist.  I absolutely HATE that.  I would love to find a well written mystery/ thriller that does not pander to the unnecessary tendency to include a love story.To me, nothing weakens a thriller like having some soppy mess thrown in just to satisfy...what?  I don't even know.  It's completely ridiculous.  In this tale you have agents navigating the woods in search of a terrorist stronghold.  These are supposedly the 'best of the best' and the situation is of dire national importance.  So what does the author do?  He throws in romantic schlock so that two of the agents can become distracted and waste the reader's time with idiotic inner musings.  The middle of a life and death situation is not the time for that crap.  It's a cheap device and I abhor authors who employ it.Along that same vein, I quickly became tired of the protagonist's wife whining about his job and its effect on their marriage.  She knew it going in, but takes every opportunity to make him feel guilty...even in the midst of a terrible national crisis.Perhaps the subsequent books in this series are better.  This one, however, seems disjointed and covers too much ground to be plausible or enjoyable.I would hesitate to read another book in this series because this one was so difficult to slog through until the end.",2,0
"This book was over so quickly!  I liked the characters.  I was sure the setting was in London from the character's behavior, and I was even reading it with a British accent.  I was wrong!  The mystery moves along with the main character acquiring this great dog, Carstairs and solving a mystery in the blink of the eye.  If there is a next book I hope the plot is drawn out a little more.",3,1

"Poor character development, improbable story line, it all adds up to a waste of reading time. The Big Green Machine does not work as adroitly as these &#34;CIA&#34; operatives. Ever.It's just not a very good book. Exaggerated action, super human exploits...just not likely to happen.",2,0
"Gabe, he's not much for another man touching what's his, ""Gabe had wanted to break Jim's pretty-boy face at the sight of the other man's hands around her waist, his lips on her skin. His Puma was growling so loudly."" Simon though the good man he is gives Gabe perspective on things, ""the bracelet you gave Chloe for Christmas when you didn't bother giving Sarah a gift."" Gabe flushed. He had a present for Sarah, he'd just wanted to give it to her in person. ""You talk to Chloe almost every day, but don't call Sarah at all."" All though there was tension between the characters which I sometimes like in my books I didn't really enjoy this one as much as the other books in the series.",4,1
"The first third of the book is way to long on explaining things like FTL and I like hard SF.  One paragraph is interesting, multiple pages of explanation is nauseating.  The ending was also poorly envisioned.  Why did I give it 4 stars then?  Two thirds of the book was good enough that I will buy the second. This is better than most of the garbage in E-books.  Be prepared to muddle through the begining and you will be rewarded.",4,1
"Not bad, but a tad on the letdown side, since right as the story was getting pretty good, she ends the book!",2,0
"I enjoyed this book, it had steamy m/m sex, romance, humor and a little bit of mystery, everything you need in a story to keep you warm on these long winter nights. I liked how the main characters seemed to have completely different personalities and backgrounds yet fit together perfectly. I also like how the author wrote in Ryan's best friend to add some comedic relief so that the story doesn't take itself too seriously. The story draws attention to a couple of very real issues in today's world Autism and the issue of how much is too much when it comes to the media digging into people's personal lives and deals with them well, but not too deeply. I only had a minor problem with the story and that was that at times the characters seemed too perfect so that the story didn't always seem believable. I would recommend this book to any one who likes m/m romance stories, but be warned there is a lot of hot, steamy sex in this book and some of it is explicit, so if you don't like that kind of stuff this not the book for you. This is another good book by T.A. Chase. - Ana",4,1

"Let me begin by saying that I really enjoy Eve Vaughn's books. ""The Reinvention of Chastity"" is one of my favorites. This book, however, had a lot of potential but the execution was lacking. The pace was too fast and the character development was shallow. The whole candy girl thing got old real quick. I would have liked to see Gabriel spend more quality time with Julie before jumping into bed with her. Would definitely recommend Eve Vaughn's other novels, but I'm just not feeling this one.",2,0

"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 6/10PROS:- The setting/occupation of the main characters is one that I know nothing about, and I found the details here and there about confectionaries interesting.- There's a good depiction here of someone admiring his love interest almost to the point of worship.- The sexual payoff is pretty good. Espinoza establishes that Josh wants Peter but is afraid to act on his desires. So when Peter makes a move, the resulting scene is long and slow and detailed.CON:- Like most short stories, this one fell flat for me because I couldn't help comparing it to what it could have been if the characters had had more room to develop.Overall comments: The guys here are sweet, and for readers who like short stories, this one's probably a good choice. It left me wanting more.",3,1
"This is a very good book, I was glad that I bought it, it keeps you interested all the way thru the book, you have a hard time putting it down, if you enjoy reading Westerns, then I know you will like this book, this Author has another one called Vendetta Trail, I plan on reading this next.",5,1
"I thought there was something to this, but as I noticed there were only a few pages left, I suspected it was going nowhere; and i suspected coreectly.  It was like the author couldn't think of anything more to add, so he just ended it right smack at the point where there should be more.  I felt like a teacher looking at the exam of a student who was really doing very well but he suddenly realized there was no more time, so whatever.  It's a pity as I thought it would have been a very good story.",1,0
"This is the best zombie series I have read in a long time. I have read every book and all of them are awesome. I will sit down to read for a few minutes and find that hours have gone by. I cannot put them down. You will love all the characters, especially Max and Stewart :)",5,1
"This wasn't what I expected at all. I thought it was going to be a reference for all those pithy, wonderful sayings that are part of the language that we hear people say and wonder who said them first, what they mean exactly, and the context for them. No, this book is full of quotations I've never heard anyone say and left me wondering &#34;familiar to whom?&#34; Archaic, irrelevant, meaningless nonsense. I couldn't even read it all, but glanced through every few pages and didn't find anything of interest or value.",1,0
I expected that this would be a full length novel . . . it was a &#34;short story&#34;  . . . followed by an &#34;ad&#34; for another work by the author. I was not what I expected and I was totally disappointed by what I received.,1,0

"A real sitcom this was. To go that long without seeing your friend but you see the others. Then you realize the entire group has secrets! Juicy, I like it.You find out you should not feel bad for liking a group member because your other friends have slept together, one set is even bi sexual. What a group of friends.",3,1
the only saving grace to this book is that i didn't pay full price to read it. so boring that i couldn't finish it. i will read just about everything but i felt no connection to the characters and even less to the plot.,1,0
This is yet another  L'Amour winner. I have yet to read a book of his that was less than great. He has the ability to keep you enthalled enough in the story to make you not want to put the book down until it is finished.,5,1
GREAT ADDITION TO THE LEARNING CURVE OF THE KINDLE.  Just finished reading the third edition of this book. I was surprised about the little tidbits that I didn't know about!!! My Kindle is used only for downloading books via either my computer or Whispernet from Amazon and of course reading them. I am not interested in using the Kindle for anything else so a lot of the book does not apply to my uses. But those that do are worth the small amount charged for this book. It is a bargain. Even my dogs are happy that I have converted over to the  Kindle since the pathways they use were growing smaller with each new book brought home.,5,1
This was an interesting story.  I will never think the same about Walt Disney's fairy princesses again.  You couldn't help but root for the heroine and her tenacity. The end was completely unexpected to me. I recommend this book to fantasy lovers.,5,1
I loved this whole series buy this book was probably my favorite.  It was awesome.  Highly recommend this author and this series in particular.,5,1
Very good author.  Will be reading more books by this author.just wish that she did not leave me hanging on the outcome.,5,1
"I finally got through this book. It is well written, but just not my thing. I remember Woodstock though I was slightly above the age to wallow in the mud with the attendees! However, this book seems to be always searching for something--the main character didn't connect with his teen girlfriend, he fails to make a complete connection with his wife which would last into the senior years, and he fails to make a connection with his teen girlfriend when they connect 40 years later. There just seems to be something missing from the whole book. Main character never seems to reach whatever it is he is striving for. The book left me wanting something more to wrap up all the dangling ends.",3,1
"This ebook was supplied to me free to read and review.This book grabbed me from the first page, although the plot is unlikely, to put it mildly, where everyone can seemingly be bought if the price is right. Eric the main character by an initial misfortune gets involved with drug smuggling and as his daughter is threatened he has no choice but to continue. Eric works his way up the drug smuggling organisation and although extreme violence and high body count the violence is almost so over the top that it just adds to the atmosphere rather than shocks. All of the characters are well developed and the plot is quite straightforward although there is a twist at the end it again does not seem likely.Summary an action packed book where you have to suspend belief but very readable with some good ideas. If you like smuggling, gang warfare, murders and extortion you will like this.",4,1
"This was an interesting book. At times it was a bit slow, but I always found myself returning to find out what happened next. I did not find a lot of the editing issues that others mentioned, so it's likely that a new edition has been released with many of those errors corrected.This was a kindle freebie, but I definitely think it's worth the 1.50 that it's currently for sale for on amazon. The author paints a very interesting world, both below and above. The world below is split up into different factions and in some ways strikes me as very 'mad max'. It's nothing particularly new or innovating, but the author makes the characters more than interesting enough to engross the reader.Upstairs is Haven, the fancy place where all the citizens live. We don't get to see a lot of this, only glimpses through the few characters we follow around. Most of them are not particularly interesting, a stark contrast with the characters below. Most of them are a bit cliche, but that changes as the storyline moves along.Overall it's worth a read, and I'm going to be picking up the next one.",3,1
Pres Lincoln's death could have touched off a much worse national response.  This short address is a straight-forward account of the President' s death.  It explains exactly what was done for him and hints at the conspiracy that could have been much worse for the country.  This report is tinged with grief and steeped in sadness.,5,1
"I stumbled across this ebook and I'm so glad I did. I compare Henry Wright to the Robert Crais character Elvis Cole. And, I only just realized this is the 1st of 6 books so I most certainly will be downloading the others right away. Awesome book and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery.",4,1
"Different little sci fi romance/erotica novella. It is told totally from the POV of the alien who buys a human as a pet. Has some age play elements so it might not be for all readers. I found the writing fairly well done. The physical sci fi elements were not strong as no effort was made to make things alien except for the the fact that they were 8 foot tall and kept humans as pets. For example, they drank coffee, no effort made to make it an alien drink. This sort of thing was consistent throughout.I enjoyed reading from the alien's view point. I felt his emotions and actions were pretty believable.",4,1
"This book is thoroughly enjoyable, while at the same time it teaches the substance and fallacies of various examples of logic. The one objection noted is that the first book does not end, but only disappointingly leads into book two. This gimmick does not cut it with this reader. Otherwise a fun read.",4,1
"The first Maggie Flaherty, Where There's a Will... was a delightful romp for a young attorney turned into a bumbling investigator.  10 c 's, the second novel in the series, fails to capitalize on the initial success and takes far too long getting to the end when the crime and most of the participants in the criminal activity were obvious very early in the story.  Maggie is a delightful character -- I hope her future cases are much more interesting and much better told.",2,0
characters strong... plot entertaining...love scenes hot and varied w/o too much kinkiness. well worth the money!,4,1

A gripping book complete with telekinesis and what seems like magic but is really science..good over comes evil in a way most could never believe.,5,1
Cardboard characters. Not worth wasting time on.Amazon required extra words so I can submit the review and read something good.,1,0
"An action novel written in the old, slow-paced style of yesteryear. The story is really hard to get into because one has to wade through so much unnecessary description.",3,1
Some of the book was a little much storyline wise. It's definitely a steamy read which was its main appeal. I prefer steamy and believable and some was just too mushy for me but overall good quick read.,4,1
"I really liked this story.  My only complaint, and the reason that it didn't get 5 stars, is that it was so short.  Other than that, it was a great book.",4,1
"I realise I'm in the minority here, but I really didn't enjoy this book. Admittedly, I was expecting a novel, I didn't realise it was a short story until I was finished with it.However, the sex scenes were rushed (I know the author meant for them to be passionate, but they came across like she just didn't put any time into reading them) and the characterisation was poor.There was no subtlety in the writing, everything was explained to the reader, as though the author couldn't figure out how to weave details and information into the story in a less in-your-face way.Having said that, I'm in the minority here, I do realise, and most people seemed to enjoy this book. It just didn't do anything for me personally.",1,0
I enjoyed the book but there was a lot of what I call over describing. It's when the description of the scene makes you start skipping part it and in your head you're thinking enough already. I get it.I also think it was a little out of balance. I think there were some real missed opportunities by taking so long for Ana and Erik to discover who they really were.,3,1
"Alma Owens narrates a very interesting picture of life in the days without running water, indoor plumbing and having baby after baby and loving each and every one of them (the children, not the hardships).  Its written in a way that if you close your eyes and listen to her words you feel as though she is speaking just to you, regarding her life when times were very very hard. Not driving she had a very limited means of getting around places until she was older and then she learned to drive.  Her husband was not encouraging in her getting out and about on her own, and in some way, not real supportive, but that was the way men were in those days.  I loved this book and highly recommend it to anyone wanting an very interesting peek into America's history.",5,1
"I had a hard time dealing with the content of this story. It was heartbreaking, and I felt so bad for the author, wanting to take her away forever. But I did not like the way the ending left me hanging, wanting me to buy the next of her books to find out how it ends.",3,1
"Terrific characters, book well written with interesting people and suspenseful happenings.  Highly recommend Elizabeth Lennox as a author--her books are always good.",4,1
"Another great story about the people of Omaha, Nebraska.  But, if you've read the ""preceding"" books of the Nebraska series, don't expect to read as much about the Larson's, as only a couple of them make an appearance in this story and it's brief, to say the least.  However, it was nice to have a peek of Eliza's (South Dakota series) previous life and how she came about to leave it, in this book.The story was made more believable by the fact that Neil and Sarah started off on a bad note, but became friends, before coming together in bed (after marriage).The message of ""forgiving ones past transgressions"" is clear and the comical ending was a very nice touch.***If you don't want to read anything sexual, please go to the author's website where you can learn the rating of her books, before you read them.  There is no point in giving poor reviews, because you don't want to see sexual content in a ""Christian Romance"".",4,1
"Another addition to her series that is a nice, short read. Even though the story is short, the characters are well written, believeable and have personality. The story draws from her series and while you can read it alone it is best read with the first of the series. Tad is a great male Alpha and Missy is a strong female Omega. There is enough tension between characters to keep you reading beginning to end without putting it down.",4,1
"An Improper Holiday by K.A. Mitchell was a charming historical romance read. I do think an accurate historical depicting a gay relationship is a particularly difficult thing to do and there is only a certain amount of scope. But, I think the book was well executed and a very sweet read. This author consistently delivers the goods and this gem is no exception. Totally sexy reading and the story has one particularly intriguing secondary character that totally deserves a HEA too.",4,1
"Fantastic story lots of suspense and horror throughout this book.  Story about young boy witnessing the death of his parents.  Raised up to be a master of combat and skills in masking himself and cloaking himself in darkness.  He goes after the men that killed his family.  This man Belgad is a powerful king of the city. The story has lots of suspense and horror and magic throughout this book.  Will be reading more of this authors books, they are fast paced and very hard to stop reading.",4,1
"I started reading this book without knowing exactly what it was, but the first lines already caught me. The beginning is almost traumatic. Everything happens in one long sentence and at that point you have to go on to find out what happens next.The story is about an American who is forced to work for a Mexican gang who traffics drugs across the border with the United States. You see the character's ascent from common man, who must count on his expertise to make himself indispensable to his new ""boss"", thus avoiding his own death and that of her daughter, to expert trafficker and unscrupulous criminal.The rhythm is that an action story, but the suspense is typical of a thriller. While accompanying the character to his descent into hell, one wonders how he will ever get out of that situation, and from time to time our theories are proved wrong by the latest turn of events.The very title of ""Borderline Case"" has the double meaning of referring to a geographical border and to a borderline patient, emphasizing the dual reading of the story.Although told in third person, in fact, the novel follows almost exclusively the main character, Eric, except for some scenes, so you end up deeply understanding and sympathizing for him. The other characters are almost all portrayed in a rather superficial way, perhaps deliberately not to distract too much the reader from the main problem (the survival of Eric) and make sure they won't mind if they got killed. Which happens often.If it were a movie in theaters, I would say that the ticket costed very little, if the price is divided by the number of deaths. And this aspect, if we talk about drug trafficking and especially action, is undoubtedly positive.Really an excellent reading.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author ofRed Desert - Point of No Return",5,1
"Tyler Newsome has left the rodeo circuit leaving his twin brother JT to make it on his own, for once. JT isn't happy about it, especially the part about Ty going home where he'll see Ren Alston again. Ren is a horse breeder and an old friend of the family. Ty has had a crush on Ren since he was young.  It seems his feelings for Ren might be mutual but they both have brothers that need them. Can they do what their families need and still make time for themselves?Bound by Love is a story with romance at heart and some seriously good kink too. There are also spankings and bondage, and one hot and romantic moment after another. Tyler is insecure. He wants Ren so much but he thinks JT is the better guy. Ren knows better and he sure shows Ty a thing or two! Keith, one of Ren's brothers, suffers from PTSD and there are many moments of heart wrenching sadness for him. It's really nice how the brothers pull together to help and support him. Bound by Love is a very sexy, romantic and good story.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",5,1
I got the first book free the August Series free hated how she had no control and had sex with all 3 brothers . I skipped the next two books because of the men sharing the other's woman. . I saw that this book was suppposed to bring everything to a happy ending  so I read it. My kindle said it was a 286 page book .I only got six chapers.It did reveal that they finally would each have their own marriage no more sharing.Lora leigh even gave a short explaination that the men had to heal.I don't know why it took 4 books to do it.I assume that since I did not read book 2 and 3. or this was only a selection from the last book.,3,1
"This was just ""okay.""  I felt Showalter sped through this short story and didn't give the characters enough time and care.  I was bumming she seemed to have hurried through this short story because none of her other books are like this.  She writes well, she has some very fun and new ideas...and I'm just sorry this book didn't get all of her attention!",3,1
This story was very entertaining.  I liked when her brother Max challenged Erik because he hurt his sister.  But truthfully Erik should have known that Annie was the one he was engaged to because of her hair color and the hotel she was staying at don't you think.,3,1
Disappointed. I had no idea it was a short story.....and I do mean short.  Glad it was a free kindle book.,2,0
wow! did this singe the eyebrows. really good price and service. did not take long to get it. my friends are taking turns borrowing it.,5,1
"The shorter a short story is, the subtler its style must be to convey its full meaning.While the premise of this one is original and potentially good, the author fails to develop his good ideas into poignant paragraphs. The result lacks any edge or humour.",1,0
"This story was well written, but someone really needs to check the spelling before you put it out there for all to read.",1,0
"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot, and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting, but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes, but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat, causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario, the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos, and misspelled or missing words. Given the above, this is not a book I would highly recommend.",2,0
"I had high hopes for this novel.  Given the subject matter and the fact that I'm a fan of historical fiction (Follett, Kalogridis) I tore into Children of Salem shortly after downloading it.I was disappointed.I won't to into too much detail about the plot.  Jeremy Wakely is sent from Boston to look into the questionable practices of a puritan minister in Salem, Mass. Jeremy has a history in Salem and is reluctant to go back but he does so out of honor...and because of a girl.  Jeremy is thrust neck deep into the mystery and lunacy that was the Salem Witch Trials of the late 17th century.The Salem Witch Trials was one of the darkest and most interesting periods in American history.  With that as a backdrop, I was very much looking forward to tearing my way through this book.It's not that Walker's a bad writer.  The historical aspects are well covered and he does give the reader a good sense of how it was for people living in that area of the country at that time in history.No, the main problem with this book is the pacing.  It's S-L-O-W.  It says it's a little over 400 pages but it certainly feels longer than that.  The book is filled with frequent drawn out conversations where the participants seem to be reiterating the same things over and over again.  Frankly, it spoiled my enjoyment of the book.I'm not an instant gratification type of reader.  I don't mind a nice build up to a big reveal or a good ending but sometimes I felt it was a chore to get through the conversations to see what the next development in the story was.The love angle between Jeremy and Serena didn't seem to 'pop', that's the best way I can think to describe it.  I think it's partially because many of the characters just seemed to read the same way.  With a few standouts, most of the characters seemed to speak the same exact way and had the same type of personalities.I don't mean to bash it.  I'm sure this novel couldn't have been easy to write, especially considering the historical aspect of it.  It just left me feeling a little let down.I didn't think it was bad, I didn't think it was great either.  I give it a solid 'okay'.",3,1
"Let me begin by saying that the only reason I completed this book was out of the shear hope that it will eventually come together.  The story was extremely choppy and just plain weird in some parts.  I found it confusing at times, so much so that I had to read pages numerous times to really grasp the concepts.  The characters are not developed well.  The potential was there but I seriously feel that the author wrote this book while ""high"" on something because it had a very strange flow.",1,0
Easy read and provided several very useful tipsWould recommend this book for purchase,5,1
This was a hard book to read for me. Not because it was bad but it isn't the type of book that I enjoy reading. There was to much far out unbelievable things happening for me.  I did enjoy the way it ended.,3,1

WONDERFUL! Jules Verne gives plausible possibilties for escapes in a hot air balloon in the midst of a hurricane. The volcanic island that the later meeting with their mystery person is just perfect. I wish I had even a tiny bit of Jules Verne's talent for writing. I love his science and his explanations that are neither didactic nor boring. And the characters are wonderful as well! SUCH a good read!,5,1
It started out okay but the ending came across as contrived.  The so-called bad guy committed suicide because he never suffered a defeat before.  Not in this world.,2,0
done in poor taste rough thoughtless not a bit of romantic just raunchy and distasteful. ugh I was looking for more,1,0
"I enjoyed this story though not as much as the other two of the series I've read. This one dragged too much. I know they were practically on an exodus through the desert but the two characters should not have made the readers feel like they were on the exodus with them. Again, it as an enjoyable read but t dragged a bit",3,1
"To preface my review, I will definitely say that this book was very well written for a such a short read. The main characters are Jayda who is able to shift to both a wolf and a cougar, her boyfriend Cole - a wolf, and Zane a cougar shifter. As the story excerpt indicates her boyfriend Cole brings out the wolf in her and through his help (intimately) she is able to shift to a wolf, however with him her cougar is latent and vice versa, with Zane she is able to shift to a cougar and with him her wolf is latent. Thse are both men who are head of their respective councils and have a deep-seated distrust for each other..you can see where this is leading!Naturally as the audience, we are privy to Jayda's feelings and the sense of disquiet she feels because although Cole wants to mate with her and she loves him, she is unable to commit to him because she is not only a wolf. We get that she loves Cole and she is torn, especially after meeting Zane, being sexually attracted to him and shifting with him. Ultimately it came to a head where she wants/needs both of them to complete her. I had a problem with the way the author wrote Jayda's reaction when she brought the two men together and had sex with them. I felt like it was all about her...I thought that Jayda's character was selfish because Cole was never given enough time to actually come around to the idea that Jayda's polymorphic state meant that both her animals needed mates. It was like she was there at the finish line in knowing what she needed to feel happy and instead of giving him the time to come around so he could meet her there, she was angry that there was jealous and resentment on his part. Ultimately it worked out, but because I felt disconnected from Jayda, it ruined the story for me!On another note, can anyone recommend an author or books where the opposite happens? What I mean is that I am tired of the same old alien, cyborg, vampire, shifter relationships where the same theme abounds...way too much men and not enough women to go around so of course there is the lucky female with two (or three) hunks after her. I would like to read about a FFM relationship where there is an alien, cyborg, vampire, shifter theme where more females than male presiding and there is a lucky guy who's got two (or three) beauties loving him!!",3,1
"ePistols at Dawn started with a hiss and a roar. Quick and cleverly written with witty dialog and characters that had me laughing my behind off, it was snarky and funny and then kinda fell flat for me in the 2nd half. Which I guess was a little disappointing as the 1st half read SOOOOO beautifully. Like blindingly clever!! Nice characters and loved the long hair. Just wanted more in the ending I think.",3,1
"I was a Catholic Seminarian for a number of years and knew about the Apocryphal writings...never had time to research them, so this was great to get on my iPad and Amazon Tablet...can take anywhere to read...fascinating stuff!",5,1
"The story is interesting from a historical perspective as well as Bing a sweet, innocent Christian romance. I enjoyed reading it.",5,1
"We should all be familiar with alternate worlds - most fiction movies or literary works that describe the present or the near future are worlds that deviate from our own in small, subtle ways - for example, the movie itself and the actors playing the parts do not exist there - or may be significant variations to what we think our world is supposed to be like - think Indiana Jones and his magical artifacts.I wish I could hint at the plot of the story and then state that I will not spoil it but a story this short doesn't have much of a plot. There's a war most of us heard of and a few minutes in the miserable life of one, anonymous actor, or warrior. The charming part, and this is what earns the story its stars is the easy, smooth, almost imperceptible transition from what appears in the beginning to be 'historical fiction' to what turns out to be something completely different.I stated in my review that this is only a teaser not because I know for a fact that it is but because I can't see any other reason why the story would be written. ""In the Trenches"" could stands its own in the pages of Analog or, better, the ""Fantasy and Science Fiction"" magazine but, even there, the readers would be unhappy if they learned that this wasn't the precursor of some large, expansive series of works mapping that strange universe for our wonderment and reading pleasure.Based on the teaser, I'd buy the 'big book' if and when it comes out.",4,1

"It's time for my first indie book review! And for my first, I thought that I would dive right in with the horror/thriller story, Serial, by Blake Crouch and Jack Kilborn (aka JA Konrath).Goodreads description:Remember the twin golden rules of hitchhiking?#1: Don't go hitchhiking, because the driver who picks you up could be certifiably crazy.#2: Don't pick up hitchhikers, because the traveler you pick up could be raving nutcase.So what if, on some dark, isolated road, Crazy #1 offered a ride to Crazy #2...This story was a short, quick read, written in a very unique way. According to the info at the back of the book, Kilborn and Crouch each built their killer, and their killer's pre-story before sharing what they had with one another. Then, they collaborated and finished it up together. Sounds sweet, huh?It's anything but sweet. As far as stories about kindred souls finding each other go, this one was dark as all hell. Even in such a short format, Crouch and Kilborn are able to stick you into the warped minds of their characters, and make you never want to be on the side of the road again. It's gory and perverted and definitely not for people with queezy stomachs.I give it umm... (wow, hadn't thought of a rating system so I guess I'll be generic for now) 5 Stars. I was hooked from page one, Serial is well written and the characters grabbed my attention. I would recommend Serial for anyone that wants a quick and bloody read.I wish it was longer, but to be fair, there is a longer story out there, Serial Uncut, that I haven't picked up yet. This one is only available in ebook format, and I got mine for free, on Amazon.com.",4,1
"I'll start off with stating that I would definitely recommend that you read this book.  That being said, I gave it three stars because while I like the story, I found it to be.... overly descriptive.  I don't often say that about books, but I can't think of any other way to put it.The issue is that the author spends WAY too much time breaking up the narrative to ""describe"" stuff-  how the water drops look, how the darkness feels, how the fungus looks, etc...  it feels like you get 3 pages of paragraphs describing someone or something in minute detail for every page or so of actual story narrative.  I found it to be very jarring to be jerked out of the story like that.  I definitely enjoy when an author takes the time to set the scene, but I think in this case, it just goes a little too far.I found I had the easiest time following the story when I just scanned through the overly descriptive parts to get a sense of the setting and then picked up the story in between.  I'm looking forward to more work from the author though hopefully with a little better editing.",3,1
"This book was just okay, the storyline was good and I liked most of the characters.  But it really needs some editing.",3,1
"I really enjoyed reading this book about Jane & Antonio who are both incredibly sexy by themselves and together. Jane and her business partner Lily own a party planning business called R.S.V.P., and Lily and Dirk, Antonio's brother, planned this birthday celebration for Antonio. It's a mascaraed/BDSM weekend where the invited guests stay at the estate for a fun filled party experience. So all guests are wearing partial masks, so every one is held in secrecy and anything you do or don't do is kept private by your mask. During the intro performance Jane is getting highly aroused, and Antonio walks up behind her and starts whispering suggestive things in her ear. Read this story because it will turn up the heat, because its a scorcher. Looking forward to reading the next two books in the series. Enjoy!",5,1
"This review was originally posted on Big Al's Books and Pals review blog on Thursday, August 23, 2012I think this book had a lot of potential, but due to an overuse of narrative, it missed the mark for me. There is some good dialogue throughout the story, but the author spends most of her time telling us what the characters think and feel, instead of showing us. When an author tells the story this way the characters end up flat, and I have a hard time connecting with them. It's like reading a text book for me.Don, the black design manager who is determined to help April lose weight, is the most honest character in the story and shows the most emotion.April was certain she could control her future by simply losing weight. While it is true that losing weight will increase your self-confidence and you will feel better, it won't make all your dreams come true., although this is the way it worked out for April. After she loses sixty pounds, all of a sudden Luis starts paying attention to her, even though he never even acknowledges that she has lost weight. Thank goodness she didn't pin all of her self worth on emotionally aloof Luis.I suspect this relationship with Luis will end up the same as her failed marriage because none of the underlying issues of destructive behavior were dealt with. An open and honest conversation between April and Luis is truly needed for both their sakes, unfortunately we never got to see that.FYI:There are a few F bombs dropped along with other adult language. Sexual situations were mainly behind closed doors.There are several editing issues in this book: missing letters, wrong words, missing quotation marks, names such as Sarah is sometimes Sara, and Harald is spelled Herald one time. There are also what could be several small OCR scanning issues as in spaces (space s) in some wording (word ing) that doesn't belong. The editing issues surprise me because I was under the impression this was a traditionally published book at one time.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.

"Reviewed By~Emma RaeReview Copy Provided By~Own Purchase for PleasureCover notes / Warnings: menage: graphic sex, menageReview: When I searched for the receipt to this book to name the source, I really hoped it was a freebie. Alas, I was disappointed.I've never read anything else from this author, but this novel was quite slow and boring in my opinion. There were some great parts, and the story had a great outline, but it seemed like a teacher assigned an outline and it was filled in by someone who didn't care. I did like the characters and the plot, but there was no heart in it. Twice I thought I'd finished the book, only to pick up my reader and find there was another chapter.It's a great idea and a great plan, but in the world of ebooks it is a common theme and plot. With no characterization I didn't care about the book and felt no chemistry or connection. Often the characters did or said things that didn't make sense. It doesn't even stand-out in the erotica if you just wanted to read some sex one night.I wasted $5 on this one. Hopefully I can save someone else $5.",2,0
"I think before I began Blurred Nights I was expecting a high heat m&eacute;nage type of vampire story, perhaps similar to the On The Edge series, also by Kallysten.  If I had to classify this book, I would say straight up Urban Fantasy with just a hint of romance.  To be honest, it took me quite a few chapters to not look for sex around every corner, behind every fleeting glance.  And that is totally on me and my dirty brain.  This book is also number five in The Demons Age series, which I have read none of them previously.  I did not feel as if I were lost, but I do wish that maybe I had read other so that I could learn more about the demons themselves.In Blurred Nights we have Marc and Blake, Sire and Childe.  Friends and lovers.  I liked both of these men quite a bit and found their personalities complimented each other well.  Where Marc is by the book and strict, Blake blazes his own path and makes the rules as he goes.  Apparently there are issues in their past, and I don't know if that is covered in another book or not.  But this has definitely caused some trust and abandonment issues between them.  While they are out hunting demons, they happen upon a group of people, and they end up going back to their compound with them.In this group is Daniel, the leader, Simon, the mage, and Kate, a soldier of sorts.  There are others, but their parts are generally smaller.  The main issue of focus here is Kate, and she sort of finds herself in a bit of a triangle with the vampires, Marc and Blake.  I liked Kate enough.  She is a strong woman, stubborn in her ways, and when she loves, she does it all the way.  What I would ultimately like is for Marc, Blake, and Kate to be thrown in a room with no doors to figure their hearts and wants out without escape.Like I said, I would consider this book Urban Fantasy.  There were some romantic kissy moments, and there was even some sex (of the Marc & Blake variety). It was mostly about the war with the demons.  Now the demons... that is where I think I could have benefited from reading previous books.  Were they mindless killing machines, or were they intelligent killing soldiers from another dimension?  Did they think for themselves, or were they driven by a singular command?  I'm still not entirely sure.  One thing I do know is that they are pretty badass and just bad. I definitely wouldn't want to meet them in a dark alley.So did I like this book?  Yep.  I sure did.  After I got out of the mindset that it wasn't all about the nookie.  That took me a moment. Would I recommend this book?  Absolutely.  Kallysten always has this free flowing familiar style to her writing.  It's always easy to follow and very descriptive.  She creates these whole worlds around these characters, and you feel like you are right there in the deserted and foggy streets with them.  Add that on top of compelling characters and the drama she injects into every story, and you've got yourself a hell of a book.",4,1
"I have to admit this is my first book for this author.  I've been keeping busy reading S. Hyacinth and A. Kell.  I thought the cover looked nice. ..So I figured, what the heck, I'll give it a try.  Well, it was surprisingly nice.I guess I'm a sap, but unlike some reviewer's, I enjoyed the cliche a and hackneyed phrases.After finishing the book my first thought was, darn, I can't believe this is only a 200 page story.  It just seemed it should be longer, there was so much going on.  And that's a good thing!With all the action, it just felt like 5 books crammed into one, but that definitely made it more entertaining to read though.With that said, there were a couple of things that I wanted to point out that made this story special for me that were not covered in any of the previous reviews. Despite all the violence and sex, (not complaining, those Were's deserved to die!  LOL ) that is typical for shifter stories, the overall theme was about family.Sasha was an abused, isolated omega, without any family, that's the beginning of the story.Then he meets his mate/spouse (beginnings of family).I've read enough shifter stories to make the whole psychology of how and why mates are attracted, superfluous, so I'm cool with the intro.Then he gets a pack, his old pack back actually (extended family).  That includes of course, Vadim's parents (in-laws).  Then there were two more facets of family that fell into place.  I won't include those as that would be too much of a ""spoiler.""  Let's just say, that if you liked theThe Lamb Who Cried Wolf [Mate or Meal 1] (Siren Publishing Classic ManLove), then you should enjoy this story too.Last but not least, another aspect I really appreciated about this author's writing was the humor.  I can never get enough of laughing.  What can I say?  I'd like to finish up with one of the many parts of the story that I found humorous.  It shouldn't be a spoiler, don't worry!  :)Oh, to understand this part, you have to understand that Vladim and Sasha are going through those uncontrollable mating urges that all newly formed bonded mates go through in shifter stories.  Hehe.Oh, and Vadim has captured Shasha in a wrestling match (sort of) and pinned him to the ground, while they are supposed to be on the way to a meeting with the beta's and in-laws. (hint...this happens to Sasha a lot! )  ;)""Vadim growled as Sasha wiggled the apex of his thighs against Vadim's growing co**.  Sasha scooted back a little as he sat up, his hands resting on Vadim's chest.Vadim gripped Sasha's hip to hold him in place over his co** when he spotted a flash of fabric beyond Sasha's shoulder.  He felt his face heat up with embarrassment.""""There's someone behind me, isn't there? Shasha asked softly.Vadim nodded, his eyes never leaving the people standing behind Sasha's back.""Sasha says ""Your mother?""""Vadim nodded again.""""Damn! Sasha said, crying out a moment later, his hand coming up to rub the back of his head.""""Stop swearing, Sasha, Anya (In -law) said.Yes, ma'am, he replied.""And Anya says ""Now, does anyone want to tell me what's going on here?""""Vadim and Sasha each pointed to the other, their voices synchronized, and said, HE STARTED IT!""Okay, maybe some people may think that's hokey.But if you can picture it...It's a riot!",5,1
"Wasn't Jacob a bit creepy in this book? I've always regarded him as the rock upon which Victor could stand, but he kept me on the edge until the end of the book. And, beware, the end of the book is open, I was for once glad for the insight on the first chapter ofCamp Hell: A Psycop Novel.I loved the story. For once it's Jacob who's having difficulties in his case and Victor (with a distressed Lisa) come to the rescue. In the previous books Jacob was the one in control, but in this book the single-mindedness with which he pursues both the resolution of his case and Victor borders on possession. Victor for once seems to be able to assert himself, even the way he embraces his jealousy was a surprise for me. He no longer accepts things at their face value, on the contrary, he questions his future and his past and he begins to handle his psychic ability.Jacob and Victor are changing and I really want to see what they become in the next book.",5,1
"I love Timothy Zahn's work!  He does what no other writer, not even George Lucas himself can do.  He takes the rank and file Storm Troopers and gives them personalities, talents, skills and makes them multi-dimensional characters that people can get invested in.Where most writers show the Storm Troopers as faceless cannon fodder who can't hit anything with their blasters, Zahn shows them as competent sharpshooting elite commandos who can think on their feet and adapt to any situation as well as follow orders.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So the story is a pretty basic one.  There is an alien warlord who is ruling a planet with an iron fist, and the Empire decides it is time to go and free the plant of his rule, so they dispatch the 501st Legion a.k.a. Vader's Fist to take him down.There is something I do wonder about though, this takes place after Vader is dead, and after Thrawn's rule has ended.  So why does the 501st Legion keep calling themselves ""Vader's Fist?""  Vader's not around anymore?  Do they keep the name just for the sake of nostalgia?  It's not really a major gripe, just something that makes me scratch my head.Our main characters are three Storm Troopers who all have different skills and specialties.  They infiltrate the warlord's fortress and meet up with some of the local freedom fighters and strike a deal with them.  If the troopers help them free their imprisoned comrades, they will help the troopers get inside and take out the warlord's troops and bring him to justice.The troopers agree and they infiltrate the stronghold together.  Later it seems the rebels have betrayed the Storm Troopers, but it turns out it is just a very elaborate ruse and the rebels were always on the side of the troopers and the prisoners are freed and the warlord is captured by the Empire and brought to justice.Later the head of the rebels is offered a position in the 501st Legion, which is awesome!  It really helps to enforce the fact that the Empire has learned that just having humans in their military doesn't help, it's a hindrance and it was the main reason the Rebel Alliance was able to defeat them.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Zahn gives us action, gun fights, intrigue and a little bit of politics as well in this story.  Any fan of Star Wars or Zahn's writing will enjoy this book very much!",5,1
This series as are most series of stories is as well produced as the others.  I must say though that the fact that they areso predictable begins to make them less exciting as you read more of them.  The most difficult thing for me is the repetitious explanation of the use and sort of weaponry and the abc soup of words used by almost everyone today.Sorry but that is how I feel.  Still I did in fact enjoy the book.,5,1
"I have to tell you how much I love, love, love this book. I haven't even finished reading it yet and I'm giving it a 5 star rating!  The characters are indearing and real and sweet with flaws like the rest of us.  These men are dealing with issues that everyone has to deal with and issues that gay men have to deal with and they make you root for them every step of the way. Lena Matthews did a fabalous job on this book and I can't wait to see how it ends! I'm in love with this book.I highly recomend it to anyone who is looking for a great romance book and has an open mind. It is about two men and the sex is really hottt, but so are the feelings and the issues they deal with.Like I've seen others write in there reviews...if you are open minded enough to read this book do so in a cool room with a glass of water near by cause your gonna need it!Got to go finish reading it now. bye",5,1
This was a fun read but far too short.  I would have liked to get more back story for all of the main characters.  It would also have been a more enjoyable read if the main characters had a chance to get to know each other.  I would read other books by this author.,4,1
"To say I am dissapointed in this short story would be a gross understatement...it's a baseless and boring storyline premise with a good beginning and pointless ending.

"I enjoyed this read. Let me first say, if your picking this book at random to read then it might seem a bit confusing. If you haven't followed the series which includes 3 books prior then it would seem a bit rushed and confusing. This novella is a good read but not strong enough to stand on it's own. I think that's why so many reviewers are disappointed with the read.Jena's best friends in past books have all met and married their true mate. At one of their weddings she happens to meet Ian. Though they briefly spoke and shared a dance, she is unable to stop thinking about Ian who is a vampire. Ian has been watching Jena for months. He is known as the enforcer, although Jena is aware that her friends married vampires Ian is sent to keep an eye on Jena watching to see if she would tell of their existence.On Valentines day everything has come full circle for both Ian and Jena as they both discover they are each others true mate. They also discovery something important about Jena's blood.",5,1

"No summaries or spoilers. HIGH LEVEL: light paranormal romance, vampire centric. Reliably romantic, surprising character development, light humor. Fun, short read. Don't let the first few pages put you off- it actually gets even better.This was a very quick read, and was a fascinating mixed bag for me, but one I enjoyed. I will admit to finding the speed at which the lust blossoms to be off-putting. It felt almost like cheap sex at first, but events that occurred midway into the story provide the necessary distance and depth.The characters ended up being very well developed. As another reviewer mentioned, the opening chapter can give the impression that this will be just another silly vamp romance with no substance. While it certainly isn't DEEP, the characters are well rounded.(As an aside, Ms. Byrne absolutely NAILED a psychologically abusive relationship that gave our heroine some issues to work through. It was so well captured, it gave me shivers.)The mythology is pretty standard vampire stuff- nothing fancy. The paranormal side of this story is relatively low key, but well utilized. The vampirism makes for some highly erotic moments and adds just a little spice to the romance. There isn't a lot of magic or mystery, though.The only other issue I really had with this story is the ending. It just ends. WHAM. Over- lights out, no reading under the covers. It felt a little like someone shut off the TV before that final scene of the show where you get that final sense of closure and all ends are tied off. It is abrupt and doesn't feel quite complete.In the end, I look forward to reading more in this series. This one, especially with that ending, felt like a tease, just a taste of things to come. It will be fun to see not just more characters in this world Ms. Byrne has created, but also how her writing continues to grow. She has a very natural style that lends itself to well developed characters. Hopefully she will give them a little more time and room in her upcoming stories.ADDITIONAL READS: More light vampire centric romance...Marta Acosta'sHappy Hour at Casa DraculaR.G.

"I purchased this story because of the setting.  I usually love Scottish romances and am a fan of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series.  I figured this would be a short, enjoyable story...and in all truth, it should have been.  It has the makings of a wonderful story, but it seems as if the author got greedy and decided to publish a skeletal outline for a quick sale.  There are too many holes, and it's simply too short to be worth paying for.  For instance, once he realizes ""Reva"" is a girl, he decides to hold her hostage instead of having her executed.  He tells her she has earned her next meal and better lodging, and then in the next sentence, suddenly it's 2 months later and they can't stop thinking of each other.  What?!  She's coming to breakfast, he's staring at her, and they've both fallen in love with each other during those 2 months, even though from what I can tell, they never actually talk to each other?  He still doesn't know who she is, and all she knows of him comes from people who live under his protection.  This is a huge fault, Jackie Barbosa.  You cannot expect the reader to believe they are in love simply because you say they are.  We need to see some sort of progression.  And then to believe that she, a strong woman who would rather face execution and surrender her family name, would blurt out that she's fallen in love with him when  he's her familial enemy?  Ridiculous!  I'm insulted as a reader that I'm expected to just go along with this absurd plot with no attempt to show me how it happened.  With more length and attention to the missing pieces, this could have been a good story.  What a waste!",1,0

Kansas from Earth is dropped head first into Oz thanks to the wizard Z who thinks he's just the right kind of man to teach the king a few things about love.  It's quirky, funny, sexy and very hot.  This novella has it all in spades and the land of Oz is not at all like I remember - this one is a hundred times hotter!  Only 4 stars because I wanted it to go on for about a hundred more chapters!  If I could do a half star, it would be right there at 4 1/2 only because I didn't want it to end.  :-)I got this book after picking up the Children of the Goddess series also by R.G. and I'm definitely glad that I did.

"I liked the premise, I even like how it ended, but I lost track of how many times they 'moaned' and 'groaned'; it was the only sound they made, sometimes 2-3 times in a paragraph! On top of this, everything was apparently 'lovely'. Essentially, the word repetition overrode the story on many occasions.Also, when a new person starts to speak, they should get a new paragraph. To have 2-3 people speaking in one paragraph, often without full stops, was very confusing.Then there was the head hopping! One voice at a time, please, and hopefully within different chapters, or if not, with double paragraph gaps between each. It gets confusing to have the point of view changed from one paragraph to another.Still, I did enjoy the storyline.",2,0

"The premise behind the story was very good and very quirkly, but the author's tone and style really turned me off, I'm sorry to say.  Even though I understand and acknowledge the fact that modern-day (young) people don't suffer from being mealy-mouthed, I really would have liked this much better if every 3rd word hadn't been a 4-letter word.  I'm really not exaggerating...  I'm not exactly mealy-mouthed myself, but I can honestly say I've never seen the 's-word' or the 'f-word' used as so many different parts of speech (often in a single sentence) or with quite the abandon that these characters use them.  I can tell that it's part of the characterization (the sole female character isn't quite as bad) but it's just overkill, plain and simple.  My vocabulary includes a lot of synonyms or alternate phrases for those words, and a little variety might have gone a long way.As interesting as the premise was, I'd suggest giving this a pass unless you happen to like extremely limited vocabulary and forms of expression.  Unfortunate, but it wasn't something that I could get past.",2,0

"I write this review after having completed book 4 and started book 5.  I do note that this and book 3 are getting negative reviews and frankly, I don't think they're deserved.  Missing proofreader?  Absolutely.  Tons of grammatical errors?  Certainly.  Improper use of verbs and nouns?  Definitely.  So drop a star off and be done with it.  Three stars is harsh, because the thing is this author definitely has the gift of storytelling.  It catches you, and makes you want to find out what happens next - and that's hard to consistently do in a series.Book one introduces Flare, who is of royal descent.  Without spoiling the story, Flare ends up leaving his kingdom to join the Guardians, who are sworn knights of a neighboring country.  The Guardians are then placed in a live-or-die situation that defines that happens next.I did have a few issues with the story.  First, the beginning part with his kingdom is totally glossed over: there's an early scene with an escort that you hope will be explained later, and it's somewhat alluded to but you really have to take a leap of faith as to what's going on.  There are no ramifications to Flare leaving the kingdom, at least not that I can tell, and he never goes back to revisit any of the people who helped him become a Guardian (with the exception of one person that he competed against).  In other words, it felt as though the author was trying to hurry up and get to the Guardians section and spend as little time as possible fully developing Flare early on.  We also never get a sense of consequence for what he's doing.Second, there are character interactions late in the story that feel random and contrived.  There's a death, and though we see a reaction to that death, it's totally blown off in later books of the series.  We don't get that sense that the death was life defining.  Trying desperately not to spoil things, but the actions in later books contradict the emotion that the author was attempting to evoke with the death in this book; goes to a lack of continuity and story flow.Lastly, there are too many sub characters. The author had so much difficulty developing Flare that it spilled over into the development of the other characters.  It's extremely challenging putting a face to each person and how they fit into the larger picture.  You know certain characters are warriors, certain others can use magic, some are female and some are male.  Beyond that, you just don't feel invested in the rest of the team.  It's as though their sole purpose is to have Flare not be a vigilante.There is an underlying plot that is reasonably well developed, and it is this plot that makes the reader want to continue with the series.  It's never blatant, never given away, just enough that you hunger for more.  If the author were to work on their character development and continuity, they would have a tremendous story on their hands. Regardless, it's worth the read if you can overlook the above.",4,1

Being human allows Kelly to handle the business during the day, but she still finds herself working a lot at night.  That's when she mostly encounters the frustrating Master vampire, Marc LaTour, who has moved in while having his own home renovated.  Marc is sexy and appeals to Kelly like no other, but she must keep her distance, because she doesn't want to end up just another meal.  Marc loves Kelly's quick wit and attitude.  She draws him like a moth to a flame.  When a threat to Kelly is revealed, he must protect her and keep her safe.  Kelly and Marc struggle to learn what they mean to each other, but in the end Fate always has her way.Rare Vintage is Book 2 in Bianca D'Arc's Brotherhood of the Blood series.  It can be read alone, but to get you more involved with these characters I'd suggest reading book 1 first.  Kelly and Marc are great characters with lots of life and electricity.  Ms. D'Arc knows how to create characters with such real emotions and feelings.

He had grown up in the four corners area and in the service had done intelligence work, he is retired and is now a high school math teacher on his way to teaching summer classes after dropping his daughter off.A niece calls while he is traveling and begs for help, her husband is hiding in the desert accused of a murder he says he did not commit and she wants Dan to investigate.  He did not think a lot of her husband and going ""home"" brought back memories.  His parents had disappeared mysteriously many years ago and his older brother was killed in an auto accident about 18 years ago.He can defend himself, but this is not an action adventure hero who mops up the bad guys with a flurry of kicks and shot gun blasts. He stays in shape but is not a combat robot, he thinks and analyses and follows clues and once engaged is very persistent.  He pulls the threads of a tangled web spun by a loose conspiracy of men who have and seek power and riches above all, letting no one (least of all family) get in their way.  An interesting hero and a good tale.  I look forward to reading other books.",4,1

"This book by Smith-Ready is ont that will catch your attion because it is so unusual. The plot is out of this world, almost, because it deals with things that are out of this world, almost. The characters are interesting and the plot has some very good points and some not so good. I did like the book.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'""",3,1

"The book, originally written just after the sinking of the Titanic, reflects the attitudes of the period in which it was published, especially with regard to the distinct roles of men and women. Obviously bereft of the insights derived from the discovery of the Titanic, it nevertheless raises two provocative issues: a fire in the coal bunker and unruly passengers being shot. However, I wish to clarify the matter of pictures which the mixing of reviews for two different editions has created.  The text of the free public domain version is well-formatted but lacks photographs. The $.99 edition from MacMay is equally well-formatted, but it DOES have photographs. The decision, therefore, is whether the inclusion of the photos is worth spending a dollar rather than getting the text for free. I think the photos, while not spectacular, greatly enhance the presentation and would therefore recommend the MacMay edition.",5,1
"I tried, I really did.  But I just couldn't finish the book.  The writing was juvenile, the characters bland.  The main character exhibits Larry Sue-like tendencies, the romance, such as it was, was flat.  People did stupid things, people were in opposition to the hero apparently for the sake of just being in opposition, and not very much of it made sense.  I don't think this book was plotted out very well.Have you ever watched a movie where the characters do boneheaded things for no apparent reason which will clearly backfire on them?  This would be that novel.I gave this a three, and this is why:  Apart from certain homonym errors - you don't ""pour"" over a book, you pore over it, the book is reasonably well edited.  The dialogue might be the strongest point, which is not to say that it's very good, but at least it isn't bad.  The grammar is never elegant, but it's never terrible.On the other hand, I couldn't bring myself to finish it.  Off with it's head!",3,1
"Question: How does an extraterrestrial civilization survive the impending destruction of its home planet?Answer: Embed your species' DNA in meteors and send them flying throughout the galaxy in hopes that eventually one of the meteors will impact on a planet that is suitable for regeneration of the species.That's the scenario for Robert Williams' first rate science fiction novel ""Peculiar, MO."" The story reminded me a bit of a cross between ""Andromeda Strain"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" but in fact it's neither. In ""Andromeda Strain,"" the action takes place primarily at a remote laboratory where scientists study the alien organism that has infected and killed most of a small town's population. In ""Peculiar, MO,"" the action is in the town itself and centers around the organism's effects on the local people and a biological terrorism military unit that is studying the alien organism and trying to limit its spread. The tension grows steadily as the unit's scientist comes to the terrifying realization that the organism is attempting to invade the earth, not just infect it.The author's scientific explanation of the mechanism by which the alien plasmids (short strands of DNA) could use earth's plants and animals, including humans, to regenerate the alien species and rebuild its group consciousness and memory is quite detailed. I don't remotely have enough science background to know how plausible this is, but it was a fascinating concept that was more credible than the typical aliens-invade-human-bodies stories. I'll give the author a lot of credit for originality.The author builds the story around several characters. The principal characters, including Kelly Ross, Spencer Dale, and the mysterious John Gordon, are likable, well developed three-dimensional characters. There are some bad guys too, and the author kills them off in some very satisfying (i.e., gruesome) ways.As another reviewer noted, the military unit involved in the story was very small and was led by a non-commissioned officer, with privates doing most of the work. This wasn't very realistic, since the government had already dealt with a previous meteor strike that contained the alien plasmids, so the potential danger was recognized. I'm guessing that the author's reasoning was that a larger unit, such as a battalion, would have brought too much attention from the local people. In any case, this is a fairly minor quibble.Having read other stories by Robert Williams, I expected the writing to be of professional quality, and it was. The story flowed smoothly from scene to scene, and the characters' dialog was realistic. The story grabbed me from the beginning, and the action is pretty much nonstop, ending in an extremely tense and violent climax. Blended smoothly into the action is the relationship between Kelly and Spencer and the blossoming romance that brings them closer together.Editing was generally good, but there were a number of typos in my Kindle version. There weren't enough mistakes to affect my enjoyment of the book, but the author should have proofread his final manuscript more closely.No spoilers here, but after reading ""Peculiar, MO,"" I don't know if I'll ever turn my back on a cat again!The bottom line: This is a first rate page-turner for science fiction and techno-thriller fans. It's certainly one of the most original and intelligently written alien invasion stories I've read.",5,1
"I really like Lauren Dane's Contermpory Romances and I am excited to find out this is the start of a serie set in Davis, California.  We have a big close family with wonderful parents on both sides.  The heroine is quirky and uptight and going through a career crisis. The hero is yummy and knows himself. Snuggle up and enjoy!",4,1

"Dylan and Sasha are two wounded souls who feel out of place at Red Rock. Dylan is surrounded by alpha males and females and feel as though he doesn't contribute anything to his new pack. Even though he killed Alan Matthews, he continues to feel guilty about putting Abigail and Brynn and the people of Red Rock in harms way. Sasha is a witch. Werewolves and witches have a long history and do not trust each other. Even though Sasha helps defeat Alan Matthews and his pack, the people of Red Rock still don't trust her.I loved the relationship between Dylan and Sasha. They both saw themselves as a hindrance to people where in fact, they were both a great help. Dylan isn't an alpha male but his protective instincts kick into gear when he's around Sasha. The attraction is mutual and they get to explore that attraction when they are sent on assignment by their Alpha Gavin. Dylan is very careful not to do anything that would scare Sasha. Sasha is stronger than he thinks. Maybe a little skittish considering what she's been through, but definitely strong.Sanctuary's Price is a good read. I think this may be my favorite book out of the series only because you see the natural progression of Dylan and Sasha's relationship starting with the first book. Dylan is sensitive without being wimpy and Sasha is scared and vulnerable without being whiney.",3,1

4.5stars -- What Do You Mean I'm Not Mrs. McKay?The worst part of the Rough Rider series is that every story whether it is a full novel or a brief novella such as this one.  It has you wondering if it is your favorite of your series. This is a peek inside Quinn & Libby McKay's marriage as they view and work to resolve their issues differently.  One area they definitely find their way back to is that old fashioned male to female communication with their bodies.  The sex is hot and the issues realistic as this short story could have been written from anyone's nine-year old marriage.  I connected with the both Libby and Quinn and we even had cameos from other s n the extended McKay clan.  It was good to see one of the already established romances after the wedding which is where the others usually end.The only difference between this entry and some of the others is the length.  The heat  -- it's in there!,4,1
"I will not write about what has already been written concerning the plot of this novel. What I will write of is the fact that there is very little to the storyline except sex. Yes, there is background on Keira, but almost nothing about William. Their relationship is not about caring and affection, but about control and domination. I read little that gave me the impression that Keira and Will were going to have a happily every after, where love and trust abounded.The sex scenes were graphic, and the language explicit. I would suggest this is for mature readers only. I think the most readers who want a loving relationship which includes a Dom/sub element will be disappointed with this one. I gave it three stars because the first half was promising. I can only recommend this to readers who like Dom/sub novels.",3,1
This is really not my thing. I can see how less than a page horror shorts work for some people and the author does an excellent job of revealing the inner-id of a great many psychopaths in less than 100 words or so but these are more &#34;pop out and scare you&#34; than the long suspense and horror I prefer.,1,0

The storyline was good. The characters likeable. Not sure if bad transfer as dreaded format changed some of the written word sBut the cadence was really off.

"I had the sample of this book on my kindle for quite some time and I finally bought it because I've been going on a reading binge lately. Can't get my hands on enough books lately. I'm glad that I read it, because it really is cute and lighthearted. I laughed quite often and kept a grin on my face pretty much the whole time.But I'm seriously disappointed in the price, considering the length. Now, I know I read fairly quickly, but really, even I can't finish most novellas in the hour I take for lunch, which is when I purchased and read this book. For 2.99, I expect it to last longer than my lunch hour, especially considering how many wonderful books I can find that are full length for a dollar more and even some for only .99. Why would I buy this when it offers me so little?Also, I'm disappointed in the amount of errors I found while reading. It's not a serious detractor from the story, but really, an ellipses has three periods, not one. If you're pausing for effect during dialogue, you use an ellipses, which has three, not one. And she does this repeatedly. One period just means that it's the end of a sentence, not a pause. I also found some words that were misspelled, like weak for week and the like.An error or two is fine, we're not perfect and I understand that, but when I'm paying money for something, I expect the author to have at least a pretty good grasp on the language and grammar. I'm tired of commas being in the wrong place, question marks when it should be a period, periods when it should be ellipses. If you don't know your grammar and spelling well, that's when you hire someone to edit it for you. If she did, then she needs to find someone new because who ever did it has a lot to learn.On to the actual story, though. I loved the characters, and I loved how Sean was so good-natured about the whole fiasco, and so willing to go along with everything, and even spurred it on in some parts. I enjoyed listening to each person's point of view and Lily Graison does that well.But because this story was so short, there's very little in the way of true characterization, and there's no real growth between the characters. I found it hard to believe that, even if both had been interested in each other for the last two years like they'd both said, that they would just go ahead and get married.I was also disappointed that we were given such tantalizing hints about Sean's past and why he's usually so grumpy around Christmas, and then were left hanging. We're never given any explanation as to his past, so I felt like that was a frivolous plot point and I hate plot points that go nowhere. It added nothing to the story but extra words, which is sad since this book is so short.  I also found it hard to believe that if Macy had put her foot down, that her mother wouldn't have backed down about the wedding. Some people don't want to get married around the holidays. I certainly don't want to share my anniversary with a holiday. Any mother would have understood had Macy just stood up for herself.Which is also why I was disappointed that their secret was never revealed. While I like the fact that it's a twist, since stories like these usually have the secret come out, I hate that what could have been used for a great growth in character was just left to die like that. Macy should have confessed everything and grown for having learned that lying will always backfire on you. Plus, Macy should have realized that she never should have lied in the first place, because she needed to learn to stand up for herself and let her parents know that she's an adult who has her own choices to make.Plus, I found it hard to believe that the mother would have worried less with Macy moving in with Sean, like Macy lied, since, if I were a mother, I would worry even more, since my daughter is in a different town and now living with someone I'd never even met. And if two years had gone by without me having met that person, I would have not only worried more, but been hurt that my daughter wouldn't have wanted me to meet this person, which is what I would have thought given how long they'd been together and I'd never seen the man.This book could have been wonderful if it had been full length and serious consideration had been given to the characters and their actions. People do things they do for a reason, and if what they do is immature and ultimately selfish, then there needs to be some growth and maturity in the book; otherwise, what's the point? I would have given this two stars, but I ended up with three because, in the end, I did have quite a few laughs, and for a frivolous Christmas story, it was nice. But it was too short and there's so much more that could have been done with it.",3,1

"This ""cheesy"" paranormal romance had me from the first line.  It is a quick novella, but I just couldn't put it down.  The title is what captured me originally, but the fun didn't stop there.  Poor Lucy is a medium that has a lot of pent up sexual frustration, and until that gets resolved she will be visited by extremely horny ghosts.  Lucy's boss, Karma (isn't that adorable!) has called to let Lucy know that in order for these ghosts to go away, Lucy will need to be sexually satisfied.  Lo-and-behold, in comes PI Jake Cox!  He is quite the hunk and just what Lucy needs to get her fix.I loved the writing style in this novella, Andrews has a way with words that just made the entire story flow quickly and smoothly.  This is book one in the Karmic Consultant series, and I will definitely be checking out the rest of the books in the series.Posted on my blog: &lt;A HREF=""[...]> A Writer's Review &lt;/a>",4,1

"Set in futuristic Vegas, we find that ""Sin City"" has lost none of its debauchery and in fact has only added to the reputation that anything goes. When Payce Halligan is assigned a new partner she is understandably horrified, working alone has created a bubble where she is not responsible for the life or death of someone close in her work. After being responsible for the death of her prior partner and love she has hardened her heart and does not plan on changing that any time soon.  However, since she does answer to the head of the Las Vegas Police Department she gets no choice in the matter.Her newly assigned partner Gavin McAllister is a good looking trainee with a faint British accent. He is an addition to her work she is not sure she is ready for.When they are called out to three separate crime scenes, all with the same M.O. they find themselves on the path of a fanatical serial killer. Each of the victims is a young woman, hung upside down and crucified, left to bleed out and with initials carved into their bodies. The ritualistic killing makes Payce think of the Amazon Casino where Costumes are still used so this is where their investigation begins. Little do Payce and Gavin know that they are about to become the hunted in this bizarre fantasy being followed by a madman.PI Barrington brings to life a very real future. Her characters are very likable and have a great sense of humor even in the dire situations that they find themselves. The story is fast paced and hard to put down, move over J.D Robb, here comes another look at the future. A gritty Las Vegas is an exceptional setting and P.I Barrington has a knack of making you feel like you are there. This is a great book to ad to your library, you will love the interplay. I can't wait for the second installment.",4,1

"The story is well plotted and provides an interesting surprise ending.  The problem is character development.  Although the author provides detailed cast information at the beginning, the people do not live up to the plan.  Men are cardboard characters.  Tom is a mystery, never fully developed or explained.  Jeremy is the weakest of the men, portraying no appealing qualities deserving of such intense love as Sabrina exhibits toward him.  Or is struggling Sabrina that desperate?Too much of the plot goes astray amidst the proliferation of nuisance details &#8230;like why did Aggie not worry about her lost purse?Aggie, the lead character, is a perpetual victim, not only of the plot&#8217;s main mystery &#8211; including the deaths &#8211; but also her health.  When she &#8220;doesn&#8217;t feel quite right,&#8221; she convinces her doctor to test for celiac disease.  Where did she get that idea?  And why did her doctor jump to a conclusion so quickly?  Blood testing may indicate a tendency toward celia problems, but a complete diagnosis requires a biopsy of the small intestine.  Aggie never had that.  People who launch gluten-free diets for reasons other than celiac disease open themselves to dietary deficiencies that often do more harm than gluten.  Even so, her recipes using white rice flour are good.  Personal note:  I have found an extra egg helps prevent crumbling in breads or cakes, without the obnoxious taste of guar gum and other gluten substitutes.The author certainly needs an editor or an astute proof-reader.  Grammar and punctuation errors abound, such as in being &#8220;late for him and Aggie&#8217;s date.&#8221;  There are comma-spliced sentences, misplaced apostrophes, and other errors such as setting off a name with a comma without adding the second comma.This had the makings of a five-star book, but I&#8217;m feeling generous in giving it three.",3,1
"Moonlight Hero takes an unusual path to romance, mixing it up with a bad guy who seems unstoppable against a happy-go-lucky alpha who shows his strengths in a less than usual way.Kiera is the heroine and right away the reader is aware she's a good girl who only wants to stay out of trouble. Little does she know that trouble, in the form of a vampire, is only the beginning of her journey to discovery. What she learns about herself, her strengths and the lengths she'll go to grab onto and keep her happiness is what made me enjoy this story so much. Another point in this book's favor is the author didn't constantly dwell on the typical internal angst that easily could have taken over this story as its conflict. Rather, she concentrated on the joy of it and I found that even the pursuit of happiness requires a diligent commitment to the earning and giving trust. Without it, there can't be emotional growth.Gabriel is the hero and alpha of his pack. He's not the typical political and heavy-handed ""I'm the alpha, that's why"" kind of character. He's a bit more laid back, mostly because of where he lives, his environment and his ignorance that werewolves aren't the only thing that goes bump in the night. In fact, he finds out the hard way that movies are so, so wrong on a lot of things. Gabriel is an alpha for a reason, however, and that becomes excitingly apparent when the tension and suspense picks up. Another thing I like is that he's not a know-it-all. Gabriel makes some misjudgments which, though at first glance I felt were a character flaw, I then realized that he is fallible, like everyone else. Just because he is a paranormal creature doesn't mean he's not going to act like a typical guy - clueless. I had real sympathy for this character from that point on because he really does love Kiera and he's so `guy' about expressing it.The villain is, of course, the vampire. He's a jerk. A warped, twisted, arrogant being of whom I thought the author depicted quite well. I had no sympathy for him at all so he's the perfect bad guy.Other secondary characters populated this story, some sounded a bit too good to be true, some were endearing and two made my interest spike. It was a good balance all around. The dialogue was fast paced and moved the plot along.Moonlight Hero is not only romantic, but it's exciting and captures the joys of being a couple who know how to heat the sheets (and do something else that I'll not tell you about). They show by example how to live in the moment and grab onto the future with both hands while making no apologies for doing so. Gabriel and Kiera's story is one you are going to enjoy.[...]",4,1

At the end of the day, it makes me smile. Bell gives a wicked humour to her characters, as well as lots of hot sex and a different take on shifters (our main characters are *human* before pumas, and have a human life, job, loves, friends). Okay, Max and Emma getting together was somewhat sudden, and she wasn't exactly given a choice with the whole shifting, but I'm willing to suspend my disbelief and just *believe*.4.5 stars rounded up.

"This was a great book and full of fun. It took a little while to gel for me, but once it did I was hooked. At first it seemed to be very bitty - it skipped from one set of characters to the next without letting me get them sorted in my head. Once I had them all straight, and the threads started to come together, I realised just how well it was done.There were so many brilliant characters and memorable scenes, as I said in my title, they keep on coming back. I think that the slapstick humour at first masks the quality of the writing. When I tried to come up with a couple of quotes that stood out, it wasn't the funny stuff, but the more quiet and reflective bits that came to mind.I thought the ending was lovely, and unexpectedly moving. It made the characters feel more real and not just figures of fun. I do hope there will be more books about them all.",5,1

"I can only guess that this book has attracted readers (see goodread reviews) because of the cursed FSOG and those readers couldn't actually handle the content...... again like other books I have read as dark as this, why can't the reader throw away their subjective when reading these dark books?  It's almost as though I feel they can't go public and admit to liking such a 'mess with your head' book.  It's not as if the author doesn't warn of the content, and it's that warning that actually totally drew me to reading this book and I wish potential readers would heed these warning before embarking on taking a book like this on.Heck no I could never see myself wanting to be anyway near these kinds of situations but I cannot applaud authors enough that deliver such a depravity filled environment so powerfully.  It's the shock factor, the scene building, the pain filled scenes, the humiliation and the sheer desperation that drip off the pages that the author must be undeniably congratulated for.  I can only imagine the talent it must take to pull a book like this off and do it so well.So, if we're going to liken this book to others I say shame on you for those that read it because of FSOG!  God this isn't even in that field, FSOG is a ballet version of BDSM, Judgment is a Rottweiler version of BDSM, it's captivity, mind manipulation, coercion, force, rape and total submission and mostly draws on the 'S' element of BDSM.  So the books I would put this in line with are, Captive in the Dark, Seduced in the Dark, The Tied Man, Undeniable for the shock factor, Underestimated for the captivity and treatment, Wanderlust for the dominance of the main character - these are to name but a few.So a brief take on the characters, oh my squirming behind, those masters!  Hateful, hurtful and totally magnetic, same goes for Tane, the Mountain Lord, this guy is one of the darkest male leads I have ever come across but I couldn't help but be mesmerised by him.  Yes the inner part of me wants him to suddenly realise what a complete A-hole he is but again he's penned in such a way that you're drawn to him in a weird way, it's almost like being compelled.Callie aka Mischief, I love that girl, my heart bled for her and my stamina routed for her.  I wanted her rebel like she was, I wanted her to be able to show them she could take everything they threw at her and remain true to herself but of course they just upped their game, total dominance is required and I felt each time a little chink of her was stolen from her.I also loved that although this is one of the darkest books I've ever read it also had its lightness, for instance (she had to remain facing the wall):-*** The door opened and I quickly snapped around to face the wall again. From behind me, a low voice drawled, ""Was that movement I just saw?""With a hint of amusement, one of the guards replied, ""To be fair, she did glance at the wall once or twice.""""That's what I thought."" ***So if you can handle truly dark erotica, not a single flower in sight, only the devil in many forms that you will like this book and if like me you appreciate the building of the book and its deliverance then you'll love it like me.  I can't wait to read Mercy and see what that has in store.",5,1

"I wasn't sure to expect when I ordered this book. I've heard great reviews, but sometimes when I get around to reading the book, it just doesn't live up to the hype. Not so in this case.I sincerely enjoyed this tale of the young, innocent Oliver Twist and his story of misfortune. While the novel was darker and more violent than I'd at first anticipated, the language flows like poetry. I loved the roller coaster ride Dickens takes us on as Oliver searches to escape the evils forced upon him, only to be pulled back in. The build to the climax of the story was expertly formulated and executed.Oliver Twist is a classic in the true sense of the word. If you've not had the pleasure of reading this novel, don't delay. Order it today.",5,1

"This bundle brings all the brothers together in this sexy as hell box set. The Buckhorn men as so damn sexy, sweet (yes even Morgan) you'll fall for them in a minute.As always Lori Foster has a great series, read this one a few times. Sawyer my favorite ( sexy as hell doctor) but Morgan although tough as nails ( or thinks he is) is lovable too. Love the closeness of family with all brothers and of course Sawyers son Casey! Who wouldn't love a house full of men (haha). Both Sawyer and Morgan love being single but know with their hometown reputations their not aloud to cut loose but when Honey breaks down Sawyers fence and Sawyers defenses he can't help but fall for this beautiful strong women. Then in comes Misty Honey's sister and when she comes to visit Morgan can't help but strong arm her into loving him. Sawyer is sweet, sexy as hell and romantic and smitten, Morgan is so hot for Misty, he can't get enough, I loved the part where Morgans Naked in the kitchen and Honey makes him dress...too funny.For both Honey  and Misty the men break down their defenses and builds them back up, even though all claim to love being bachelors they get a case of the love bug. Another great series to follow. Can't wait for Casey's storyGabe/Jordan although liked Sawyer and Morgan in buckhorn beginnings more, this sequel is good. Very sexy men, courageous women. Fun and loving family. Great read but wasn't as good as the first book. Even though Jordan and Gabe sexy as all their brothers it wasn't as sexy a story, they both felt almost pushed through to get their happily ever after. Gabe and Jordan are both well sought out bachelors but once they catch their  ideal women their as lost as their brothers. It just felt too quick and rushed I pared to Sawyer (my fav) and Morgan (so sexy)",4,1
This book was AWFUL. The only reason I downloaded it was because it was FREE. Even though it was free it took time out of my life I will never see again.I read the other reviews and am wondering if we even read the same book?

"This book it basically literary candy - nothing substantial but a quick fun read. The lead characters are enaging, as are the secondary characters (who become the focus of later books, so the author does a good job of rounding them out here to get you interested in them). Although the world she created was interesting, I found the whole ""guide"" thing kind of disturbing.I don't normally read romance novels (this was an impulse purchase b/c of the low price b/f I realized what it was about), so I'm not sure if fans of that genre would like this book. There was definitely romance and sex, but it wasn't overpowering and mostly fit with the overall story.I really like Moira Rogers, so even though I don't read this genre, I read her stuff. Her writing style is easy and flows well. She doesn't try to make her books more than they are.I've now read all three books in the series, and they get better with each book, especially the third book focusing on Dylan.",3,1

"Weekend Pick Me Up - Surviving The Fog by Stan MorrisSometimes you get a book or one is recommended to you and you read the synopsis and you cringe and you just don't want to tell the person that--&#34;No, this book just really is not for me. Thanks, anyway.&#34; You probably feel guilty or pained because it means a lot to the person and it really would make them happy for you to show an interest in the thing that they enjoy, but try as you might, you just can't imagine this book in your lifetime, or for that fact, the next one either. This book had no true blaring faults when I read the synopsis, but when I read it I worried I might be having that feeling because it would be a &#34;boy-centric&#34; Sci-fi. BUT I WAS WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! It was sort of &#34;boy-centric&#34;story but I totally got into this book and loved it hard.Stan Morris's Surviving The Fog begins with a group of youths between the ripe ages of twelve and eighteen spending a three week stay at a summer camp retreat in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California for an abstinence camp. They are there to learn about different birth control methods but ultimately to make a pact when faced with a sexual situation to take the high road and abstain. But shortly into their stay the Admin of the camp and the Counselors go lost and never return leaving roughly fifty youths with one counselor whose mental stability quickly devolves leaving them all alone. Knowing something very wrong has occurred thirteen year old Mike and his friend sixteen year old John attempt to make contact with the outside. When this fails they spearhead taking control of the camp before things get out of hand. It takes a while before a hierarchy is established but when it does, it is thirteen year old Mike who is the &#34;Chief&#34; of those left in the camp.When I started the book I had the odd feeling I was dealing with the set up of a 1980's slasher film. The young adults, isolated with the ominous feeling of impending suspenseful doom. Danger awaiting them and always a threat. After a couple of threats that feeling disappeared and something reminiscent of a happy telling of Lord of the Flies came to mind. Once it really got rolling I wanted more and more to keep going. I really didn't want to put it down.A whole lot happens in this book from point 'A' to 'B' and a good deal of detailed steps that add many dimensions to the large cast of young adult characters. Eventually, they come into contact with more people and their camp becomes the village of Petersburg--named for one of the founding members who helped establish peace at the camp at the start of the story. The happenings during the expansion will disturb many readers brought up in the black and white societal view delineating when a child becomes an adult. Also probably rural and urban upbringing will see the relationships that occur in this book differently as well. Many people will be offended or have argument with the later portion of the story.This story is a rather romantic view of communal living as a best possible outcome. Stan Morris's character's faith in human goodness and their ability to do what is best for one another in the face of a crisis is the vehicle that carries the story. For the most part the encounters with inhumanity that occur within the book are met with swift and severe punishment. It's the very definition of dura lex sed lex, the law is hard, but it is the law. However, in a times when humanity is tested, inhumanity will gather its forces. I really felt that there should have been a great deal more grief and strife. More uprising and usurping of power. The history of man does not really show a history of peace. Most of man's time on earth has been spent in bloodshed and a thirst for domination.The book had many issues which need a tune up. As good as the novel is it is just a little too long; it needed to be edited down just a bit so it wasn't so heavy to shoulder. I had no real beef with the simple writing style. Many might complain that Stan Morris's writing is too basic or undeveloped but for this book. The narrative being that of a thirteen year old boy, I truly thought he hit the nail on the head. The novel was too male centric and desperately needed to be balanced by more active respected female characters. I also felt that despite the pairing of couples that there never seemed to be any rhyme or reason for those relationships. I think he could have worked on developing a better psychological connection between them so it wasn't as dry and clinical as it came across.I wish I knew of books to compare this too but in my mind it really stands alone. I do recommend it and I'm suggesting it as a Weekend Pick Me Up but this one is one for a snowy or rainy weekend where you need to be taken away and forget this world for a little time. (This review was written for my blog All The Things Inbetween at Alicrean.com)Kathy's Synopsis:Kathy&#8217;s Recollections is about a group of teenagers attending a camp in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  The camp was designed to preach abstinence and teach methods of birth control.  After a week, the cell phones are not connecting, and the mail has not been delivered, so the camp administrator and most of the counselors leave for a short visit to a nearby convenience store.  They never return.  After another week it become clear to one boy that something has gone seriously wrong in the world.  Then the campers discover that they are surrounded by a mysterious brown fog that appears to cover the earth below 6,700 feet.  The story is narrated by fourteen year old Kathy.  She focuses on their efforts to survive the elements, outsiders, and each other.",4,1
"Number one, ditch the cover... It's not a bad cover, the art is beautifully done, but there are so many vampmire books out here, and they all have blood dripping from fangs, that I almost did skip over this HIGHLY original story despite it being a free download. Haven't checked to see if the next book is already on sale, but if so I will be grabbing it tonight to continuing reading. Kudos to this author for making me fall in love with the characters over and over again throughout the book. Even the ones I hated, I loved! That's how beautifully written they were. Two's loss/gain in the end literally put me in tears. I could hear the swell of background music as if I were watching a blockbuster on the big screen. Very emotional, Very much anticipated after Two & Tori got their revenge. Loved it. Don't want to put in nany spoilers...just wanted to say: Amazing Read!",4,1
"I thought with Christmas creeping closer and closer it was time for me to start reading some festive novels and get into the holiday spirit. I saw Holiday Bound recommended by Amazon in their free Kindle ebooks section and thought it would be perfect to start my Christmas reading.I found the premise interesting but unfortunately due to length issues Beth Kery did not explore the subject as thoroughly as I would have liked.Alex is an interesting and layered character (as layered as one can be in such a short novella), thankfully Beth Kery spends enough time to give us details about his background with his father so that the reader understands the complexity and problemacy of their relationship.However, somehow Beth Kery forgot about Angeline along the way and left her standing there without giving us some depth into how a woman who has been going out for 2 months with a man can after only spending a couple of hours together with that man's son sleep with him based on physical, sexual attraction. And even later, once her hormones subside, we don't get too much of a glimpse into the workings of Angeline's mind and feelings .My other complaint is the ending of the novel, I found it too improbable and a clich&eacute;, and I missed that after the big showdown between Mitch, Alex and Angeline nothing was resolved: neither Mitch and Alex, or Alex and Anegline or Angeline and Mitch spoke about the problem and what to do about the situation!Verdict: But overall the attraction between Alex and Angeline is sizzling, and the dominating yet protective alpha maleness of Alex will make anyone feel hot and bothered. A nice short book to read by the fire on a cold winter night.The cover is a great representation of the book, so you know what to expect when starting it: Holiday Bound is a sparkly festive, sexy and saucy story :-)Plot: 8/10Characters: 7/10Ending: 6/10Writing: 8/10Cover: 9/10",4,1

"This book, for me, was highly disappointing. I was expecting so much more. The author tries to be funny, but fails at it. A lot of the book is very cliche and cheesey. Most of the tips were things that you would do with anyone, not just  a vampire. Also, most of the tips are common sense things that you do while traveling. The character is never explained in the book, or given any background. In the introduction, her thoughts and sentences are very sloppy and flighty. Instead of explaining why she was giving tips, she just made me confused. This book was free for Kindle, and I am thankful that I didn't pay anything for it because I personally, would want my money back. Honestly, I don't recommend the book to anyone.",1,0

"Sacred Fate by Eresse is set in a hermaphroditic society with lashings of fantasy and rather epic world building. The story was pretty engrossing and a lot of that is down to the world she's created and solid story telling.

I liked the story for the most part, but found the Lassen very hard to warm to and Rohyr almost too overbearing. An interesting and unique story.",3,1

"Katie McCormick knows all about the concept of adding insult to injury. Not only is her spoiled younger sister marrying Katie's ex-boyfriend in a four day event that is destined to make her stomach turn, but her mother is pushing her into accepting a date for the interminably long weekend with the son of her mother's best friend. Howie. They'd met once when Katie was thirteen and Howie about sixteen and the scrawny, nerdy brainiac didn't exactly endear himself to her. Her mother, though, is intent to torture her...though she's couched it in concern for hard family questions about her still-single status.Howard Jackson Kent, who goes by Jackson now, is equally disdainful of the idea when his mother pushes onto him the idea of accompanying Katie as her date. He remembers their one meeting years ago. Katie intimidated the heck out of him and threatened to beat him up. It was a less than auspicious beginning that he had no intention of seeing go any further. Nobody, however, can manipulate like a mother, and he reluctantly agreed as he girded himself for a weekend of torture.When they meet again, however, it's blatantly clear to both that the years have been kind. Katie's turned into a really cutie and Jackson's the definition of eye candy. As they get reacquainted and find out they have quite a lot in common, a new friendship and sparks of attraction fly fast and hard. Maybe their mothers weren't such horrible tyrants after all. And maybe it's true...love is really always in the last place you look.I had a pretty good idea very early into this novella that I wasn't going to be as happy with it as I'd hoped. Her sister not only stole her boyfriend, but is marrying him a year later. That's just skanky. And while Katie is now over it, I couldn't help but genuinely loathe her sister for that...and for every single scene she was in. The spoiled, petulant witch needed to have her bouquet stuck somewhere far less pleasant, let me tell you.But the story isn't about her sister. It's about Katie and Jackson. They were fine characters, though a little two dimensional. There's not a lot of time to develop characters in short novellas such as this, though, so I'm pretty forgiving about that. I'm less forgiving about the cliched aspects of the plot (five minutes in and I knew exactly when I'd see Katie and her ex come face to face), and as a reader, I hate romances that shove strangers together and have them falling in love and getting engaged days after meeting (or, as in this case, re-meeting). I'm all for Happily Ever After, don't get me wrong, but it's so hard to maintain a suspension of disbelief in those cases. It didn't work for me at all.The wedding festivities were, admittedly, over the top with the hijinks, but there was also plenty of humor there and I did appreciate how Jackson handled some of Katie's less than pleasant relatives and a few dicey situations. In fact, I don't have any complaints about either of them as characters and am forgiving of most of the constraints that the novella-length story put on the plot. It was the overall concept of the plot, the wretched sister from hell, and the completely implausible culmination of their weekend that I didn't like.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",2,0
"~* 3.5 Stars *~It's innocent, if slightly indecent fun. About as indecent as the shy and a little uptight Hailey Jennison gets, actually. She and her friends get together every Friday night for some very specific girl time. Gathering around the window in her friend's apartment, lights off, snacks and drinks in hand, they look out the window and down into the apartment of the man they refer to as Mr. Tool.The man is smoking hot and has a habit of walking around his apartment barely clothed, sometimes not clothed at all (and aren't those happy nights!), with his lights on and his shades up. Hey, a girl's gotta grab whatever salacious fun she can, right? It's harmless and he's the man of her dreams - literally. Then she goes out to get some more booze for the girl's night and Mr. Tool confronts her about her and her friends' weekly activities.Mr. Tool...Gage for those who actually know him as more than just a bit of man candy, gives Hailey an ultimatum. Either she goes out on a date with him, or he calls the cops and files a complaint about her and her friends' weekly peeping.For six months Gage has been hoping for a chance with Hailey. She had moved out of the complex before he worked up the courage to talk to her, but he caught her and her friends spying on him one night and has gone out of his way to make sure she has plenty to see ever since. True, blackmailing the woman for a date isn't exactly the most gallant thing he's ever done, but it got the job done. Finally. Now, if he can just manage to get through the date without opening his mouth and sticking one or both feet into it.To say Gage is socially awkward around women would be a gross understatement. It makes starting a relationship hard, especially when he is as attracted to a woman as he is Hailey. A little blackmail seems a small matter for his pride, though, if it gets him a shot with Hailey.~*~This deliciously erotic little bit of yumminess was fun for a hot, quick read. The plot was a bit light, and I'm not sure I bought the whole gorgeous-guy-has-to-blackmail-a-girl-for-a-date concept, but the characters were likable and the sex was abundant and hot. Sometimes, that's all I need to be happy with an erotic novella like this.I liked that there was a surprisingly plentiful cast of secondary characters. The length of the story didn't give much room for them to be fleshed out very well, but spending time with Gage's family and Hailey's friends did add a bit of depth to both main characters. Depth that I enjoyed. I was amused by the relationship between Gage and his brothers and mother. Those weekly breakfast/guilt sessions and the sibling ribbings that went on seemed very natural to the characters and situations. I enjoyed them a lot.I wish that Harte had pushed the envelope of Gage's awkwardness around women even further, because he never really struck me that way when he was around Hailey. He certainly wasn't Mr. Charming, but to have built up the level of neurosis he had over his lack of ability to speak to women without saying something wrong, I would have expected him to be much, much worse than he was. Maybe if he'd been even more blunt, or less endearing with his clumsiness, I would have bought into it a bit more.Hailey didn't do much for me, really. She didn't annoy, but she's too familiar as the uptight, tightly wound Type A personality bordering on prissy. The girl with a killer bod and an ice maiden exterior fashioned from her fear of pain. I wish more originality had gone into her character, but she at least held her own.I'm not a fan of the quick-to-love theme in romance, even in erotic novellas. That, for me, was the bigger issue with the story. I wish the romance had been given a longer lead time, even if it had been in condensed form. I also would have liked a meatier plot, and I'm no fan of relationship conflict that's nothing more than a failure to communicate, as it was here. Those are the things that held me back from completely liking what I read.It was hot, though, I'll say that. And I do have a soft spot for the themes of unrequited love (or lust) and love (lust) from afar, like Gage had for Hailey. He was kind of geeky-cute with his affections and I enjoyed that aspect very much. For a quick read that will definitely raise a gal's body temp, I'd recommend this one, but I personally would have liked more story and a less annoying conflict.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",4,1

"From the moment he met him, Gregory knew Ryland was his mate, but when they met Ryland was much to young to claim. Six years later Gregory finally makes Ryland his only to learn he may lose him.  To Gregory, Ryland has always been special, but he discovers what sets Ryland apart from the other wolves in their pack may be the very same thing that kills him.Ryland didn't understand all of the ramifications of being a tri-omega, all he knew was that he loved Gregory and wanted nothing more than to have Gregory claim him.  Being claimed by Gregory was everything Ryland dreamed it to be, but his dream may come to an end when he and Gregory discover that their happily ever after depends on someone they never met.Forbidden Desires was a good follow up book in the Tri-Omega Mates series.  I loved Ryland from the previous book and adored him even more in Forbidden Desires.

"I am a huge Debbie Macomber fan, there's not too many books of hers that I haven't read.  After saying that, her best writing, in my opinion is her Cedar Cove series.  With 12 books total, the books follow a cast of characters through life and hardships.  The series starts with 16 Lighthouse road and ends with 1225 Christmas Tree Lane.  It's easy to know where you are in the series based on the title - the first number in the title is the corresponding number in the series.  Debbie Macomber's characters draw you in and make you feel as though you are part of the plot and by the time you have finished the book(s) you feel as though some of the characters are you best friends as with Olivia and Grace.

"I was leery of this book due to the ""teenage"" appearance of the cover. Thought it'd be a cheesy vamp/romance. Totally untrue! From the first page I was HOOKED. Great read. NOT for teens. Don't let the R.L Stine- ish cover fool you...it's pretty intense in places. Also, for those of us ""less discerning"" readers, lol, it's a book that took me into the world far enough that the inconsistencies didn't negatively affect the book in the least. I do however hope that the next one has an even better flow.",4,1
"First of all: I love Josh Lanyon, what can I say, he's one awesome writer. So far I haven't read anything else by Laura Baumbach, so I can't really say anything about her..I really, really enjoyed the first part of the book, the part before the drug bust - it has everything I'm looking for in a great book: suspense, romance (kinda like Romeo & Juliet - at first, well I said kind of :) ), a twist and a big bang, so to speak...Both characters are great, I especially liked Miguel Ortega, Gabriel's ""love interest"", like the blurb gives away..The 2nd part (which was good as well) felt more like a sequel to the first one - but I'm not entirely happy with how things turned out with Gabriel. This spoiled the story for me at some point.Maybe, that's just me - I mean, I'm not totally against this kind of storyline, at least when expecting it at some rate, but I was totally surprised by this course of events, I did not expect that at all.(God, I probably sound nuts here trying to review this novel without giving away too much of the storyline ;D)So, my advise: Read the book yourselves! It is highly enjoyable.",4,1
"So, not the worst book I've ever read, but certainly not a good one!  Great concept, but the writing was lacking.  As another reviewer said, all the problems in the book were ""solved"" by having sex.  The sex scenes were good, if a little corny at times, (really, having sex while he sprouts wings and levitates them above the bed?!).  That's about the only thing this book was good for.  The author's descriptions of anything except the sex scenes were poor, (I never even felt like there was a decent description of what the dragon form looked like).  And the heroine was incredibly foolish and weak, repeatedly getting herself into scrapes he has to save her from.  I HATE stories with weak women constantly in need of rescue.Amazon needs to introduce a refund program, so you can get at least some of your money back for bad purchases.  If you're looking for a story with sex and not much else to recommend it, you'll probably like this one.  If you actually want a STORY to go with the sex, save your money and look elsewhere!",1,0
"A short story. It is well written, yet lacks essence. The idea of a space colony and sleeper ships is not new, so it requires a really good plot to keep me interested. The plot is not very original. [[SPOILER ALERT]] Spaceship has been traveling for a long time because earth is over polluted(this has been done before), they send a scout ship to find a landing spot for the colony(not a new idea), {epic science fail for not sending a probe ahead to measure the density of the atmosphere}, atmosphere is too dense so scout ship crashes(ships always seem to crash), everyone but the protagonist dies(how new...). Oh yeah, and then there is the fact that the scout ship needs an engineer in the engine room, that the engines have to open up for firing, and a whole other range of things that are not at all founded upon science, such as the simple fact that the spaceship should have been decelerating prior to the arrival at the planet. [[END SPOILER ALERT]] This story seems to be like most science fiction that is being written today, almost worthless.Story neither interesting nor innovative enough to get me to buy the other three novels in the trilogy...And a word on the cover art. It is professionally designed, but it seems like the cover art of a horror novel, not a science fiction one.Overall a very disappointing novel, I would expect more from an author who has taught creative writing at Oxford.",2,0

"This bundle contains 3 of the 4 books in the series of the Buchanan Family, made up of 4 siblings and a grandmother. All books are well written and keep you interested.  They are about finding true happiness and dealing with family and issues that happen within families.  Each sibling gets their own story.Cal is the oldest brother; he hires his ex-wife Penny to re-vamp the family's flagship restaurant that used to be the pride of the family and now is on the edge of closure. Penny is a popular new and upcoming chef in the area but does not have enough money to start her own restaurant or start a family (even if it is on her own) she desires. She accepts Cal's offer in exchange, she has a few stipulations of her own. This story is about second chances, very sweet.Walker is the third brother and an ex-marine.  He leaves the military after his experience at war and comes home with ""baggage"" and needs to adjust to his new life.  His story is about adjusting, learning to trust others and allowing others to love him.Reid is the middle brother.  He was an ex-athlete who retired too early because of an injury.  He is used to his playboy ways and finds himself running the family owned sports bar.  He has problems with commitment as well as maintaining relationships that last longer than one night.  He hires Lori to take care of his grandmother.  Lori is the first woman who did not throw herself at him, so he is intrigued by her.I really enjoyed this bundle.  It was great to see how the story of this family, the drama around it, the romances and issues continued from one book to the other, and everything flowed really well.  It is worth reading. I couldn't stop reading. Pick yourself the last book as well to complete the series.  The last one is about Dani, their youngest sister.",5,1
"I really enjoyed the characters in this story. Although the hero is the ultimate alpha male, the heroine is the perfect balance and stong in her own right. The perfect couple.",4,1
This was the first of Mr. Sides books i had read. His style of writing and attention to detail are superb. I greatly enjoyed it and have purchased the rest of the series based on this one book. If the Peacekeeper makes its way through south Alabama I for one would be honored to join.,5,1
Have several different versions of the Bible in 'hard copy'. Nice to have one available on my Kindle for when I travel.,5,1
I caught the religious tones in the book. It was threaded into the story quite well. Some people will find it distracting. I am not sure how I feel about it as I read it as part of the story and not a push for religion. Not sure if I will read the rest if they are heavy on the god thang.,4,1
I only read part of this book. I just couldn't get into this story. Maybe you will? I guess I just wasn't in the mood to read a story like this when I got it.,2,0
I haven't gotten time to read this one yet. I intend to read it soon though. Looks like a good book.,5,1
"This book was a good one for someone looking to read an apocalypse survival story that is somewhat believable, at least from the realism of characters.  It does take a little stretch to think that kids could do so much, but at the same time is a testament to what might be possible when survival is on the line. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will definitely be suggesting it to others.",4,1
I guess. Didn't really get into it. To my understanding this is apart of a series don't know if I read the previous books or  if it would make a difference because most books can stand on their own or you would need to read the series to fully get into it. I was a little frustrated even though I fully read it but it's not a book I would re read again.,2,0
As an aspiring yogini this is required reading.  It's not an easy read but it's essential and the translation was good.,4,1
this was a good read.  I will even go so far as to say I will read it again when some time down the road. I will also seek out other books by this author.,4,1
"Reviews are mixed on this book and so are my feelings regarding it. The basic storyline is a very good one but somehow it just doesn't &#34;feel&#34; right. Part of the problem with a book written in the first person is that it can seem like an internal monologue all the way through and boy, can this person monologue! The whole book is written like she is talking to herself and as such I feel that it loses that certain something. I will also say that the endearments become a bit much too - nearly every sentence includes &#34;my man, my love, Lucien-love, my heart&#34; and, like the monologue, it just becomes monotonous.On the whole, a good story (if you can find it) and some good characters which would benefit from more development. There are hooks in the story which make me believe that there will be another book in this series. Not sure if I will read it but the jury's still out on that one.",3,1

"Lovecraft was one of the first to write  horror fantasy.  I was interested in looking at the settings and worlds he created as a starting point for one of my own stories. These stories are very dated and therefor not very scary to the modern taste.  I personally don't think Lovecraft was more than a mediocre writer, but l got what I wanted out of the stories.",3,1

"This is the 3rd book of the Out of Uniform series by Elle Kennedy. I have really enjoyed this short series so far, but this one would probably be my least favorite. This is the story about Will and Mackenzie who have been friends for over 15 years and Will has been secretly in love with her all this time.  Mac thinks of Will as her best friend, someone she can count on and that won't leave her.  It is safer for her to keep him as a friend instead of becoming involved with him.  One day, she kissed him and for Will, that was the day there was no turning back.  He had to have her and had to convince her he was the man for her, that he loved her all this time and that he was tired of waiting around for her.  Mac has a special ability, where she sees the future.  She has seen images of Will and her and knew in her heart they would get involved and when they did, oh man, it would be hot!  After their explosive night together, will sees images of Will falling from a helicopter and freaks out.  She didn't want to continue the relationship because she feared if she did, she would lose him so she pushed him away.This one is not my favorite from the series, probably because I thought the main characters were not that interesting, but the story was nice and short.  It was nice to catch up with the other characters from the previous books, so that made it worth reading.  Of course, I am a sucker for romance and liked the steamy scenes and a happily ever after.  Can't wait to read the next book...",4,1

"Although I haven't finished reading this book, I did enjoy the first few chapters.  The author gave clear and simple instructions---just start writing.  And DESCRIBE, DESCRIBE, DESCRIBE. . .

I think this book is a good start for people like me who would like to start writing (more for my own enjoyment).  I'll update this post as I go along.",4,1
"As has been pointed out in some of the other reviews, this has alternating point of views between the hero and heroine, and its written in the first person for the heroine's sections. The effect was jarring to me, and I really wanted to skip whole chapters, especially when she's describing her own body as ""hot"" and centerfold worthy. Made her a lot less likable.  Then there are the continuity issues. In chapter 3 her internal monologue includes, ""Mr. Lebeaux. God, I didn't even know his first name.""  Then a few pages later ""the portable lantern Simon had left..."" half a page later ""hoping Simon would suddenly remember..."" so you think, well maybe she does know his name after all. Then in the next chapter she asks him ""What's your name?...Your first name."" There's a couple of other gaffs too but that one nearly made me give up on the book.The heroine goes back and forth between contemplating how many guys she's been with in college to then saying things like ""I don't have a lot of experience at this,"" when she's underneath the hero. The first half of the book as so many pages about her talking about being ""horny"" that you just want to tell her to get a life.I've read the other books in this series and they were okay. But this one, even though the premise was good and Simon was sympathetic enough, was overall a clunker.",2,0

"This started out as a realy good book although it seemed to do a lot of jumping around once I got to the meat of the story. It was entirely too many typos and grammer errors which took  away from the story. I really wish our wonderful black street lit authors would please have someone else proof read these books before releasing them. This author will one day be a great writer. They just need some help with proof reading. I felt that the main person Mercedes was really a uneducated young lady. You and your girlfriends said one thing but you turn around and do another. For instance: Im not messing with no more hustlers!, damn it you get some good d&%k and turn around and marry a stranger, just cuz he can keep you in the lifestyle you've become accustomed too. She saw all the signs of what this man was up to but choose to ignore them. Then you let him uproot your family because he is into some skull duggery. I hope that any ladies especially the young and impressionable ladies take sdomething from this story. There is a message which she told us about at the beginning of the book.  Great book Winter!! Waiting to read book 2.",3,1
"I  loved Cry Sanctuary. I read this book in a couple of hours. My only complaint is that I wish the book was longer. Because the book isn't that long, the relationship between Keith and Abby developed rather quickly. Keith is the typical Alpha male. He's strong and responsible. Abby is a newly turned female who needs a strong male. Her attraction to Keith was instantaneous. I loved that Abby's character wasn't wimpy or whiny. Of course they are going to be good together. The sexual tension between Keith and Abby is palatable. But in typical hero fashion, Keith tries to do the right thing by resisting Abby and letting Abby make an informed choice on who will be her Guide.Cry Sanctuary has the typical elements of a werewolf story - at least werewolf stories that I've read. There's the Alpha male leader of a pack that doesn't follow the rules and treats the women badly. The alpha male from a neighboring pack has to step in and rescue the woman. In this case, two women - Abby and her sister Brynn. I'm looking forward to the second book which is about Abby's sister, Brynn.",3,1
"4 out of 5 stars! This is an erotic feast that spices you up with a plot keeps you wanting more. Even though this is a short story it is filled with love and passion.

"This writer truly, truly needs to do some sort of historical research before writing  an &#34;historical&#34; romance. I'm not asking for the meticulous research of &#34;Gone With the Wind&#34;, &#34;Forever Amber&#34; or any other classic historical, BUT a debutante would never, EVER be allowed to attend balls, parties or a walk without a CHAPERONE. Seriously! A carriage ride would have called for at least a MAID to accompany an unmarried, well brought up young woman.  This was just ridiculous. Ms. DeGioia, please do a tiny bit of research of the social mores of the time period you're writing about. UGH! A long dress and a carriage do not a 'historical&#34; novel make.",2,0
"It wasn't bad.The story was simple. Werewolf loves She-wolf and vice versa. They're mates. They get it on. There were only 2 complications to the formula. The first being that they're ""distant cousins"", but only because the author was too chicken to make them actual siblings. The author made them ""adopted"" siblings anyway so you had the forbidden thing going without becoming icky (even though siblings was clearly what the author wanted to happen anyway!) The second complication was the criminal investigation element. The main male character was a cop and the female main got caught up in a case he was working on. Both of these complications weren't really looked into with great detail. They were just there.***UPDATE: Sorry, my mistake... Kinsey Holly pointed out to me that the main characters aren't cousins, just related by marriage. I also apologize for jumping into conclusions when I said this is what the author intended. I just read too much into it, so forget I said anything about it needing to go into more detail. The only reason I did was because I was looking for more ""mental/emotional turmoil"" plot associated with this particular element, like how to justify the ick factor through love. Different story, different circumstances... Mea culpa. (I'm not being sarcastic, just to be clear.)****The characters themselves had very little personality to speak of, but they didn't need to in order to serve the purpose of this book. The purpose of this book is to have sexy scenes with 2 werewolves. It had that, and they were good scenes. I personally had a good time reading them, but then again I'm quite fond of sexy werewolf stories in general so there's some bias there.3 stars. It was a good werewolf sexy story for werewolf aficionados but probably won't make non-werewolf lovers into were-fans any day soon. Still, they might appreciate the sexy bits anyway since they weren't bad.***UPDATE: Kinsey Holly also pointed out that there are no female werewolves in her universe. Sorry about that.****",3,1
"I have read the other reviews and clearly am in the minority when I say this story sucked. A former werewolf bounty hunter, who was the progeny of a werewolf bounty hunter, becomes a werewolf himself. The story never mentions gramps trying to kill hus grandson so it was just odd that the author kept mentioning his lineage. Lucy made my teeth hurt. One minute she was a vixen and the next a victim running from a werewolf through the woods. Justina's ex being a werewolf was a totally random an unecessary plot twist. The author could have informed the reader about Oz being an assassin a different way. All in all it was a waste of mo ey for me.",1,0
"I know it's by a classic author & I feel I should join the positive reviewers here, but I'm afraid I can't.The book starts well enough, with a daring prisoner-of-war camp escape, by balloon, followed be a harrowing flight through the storm & a forced landing on a Pacific Island. Then the plot weakens....One of the book's biggest mysteries must be that, whilst huge numbers of indiginent Pacific islanders evolve by scratching out a living fishing off a sand-bar of an island, this extemely large, visible (it has a huge mountain in the middle) island, remains undiscovered. A pity because this surely must be one of the most verdant, farming-friendly, mineral wealthy islands on Earth. It is also extremely well-stocked with all manner of useful, & tasty beasts. Our heroes, in a few short years, manage to become completely self-sufficient & are soon spoilt for choice as to where to abide & what to have for supper.I would estimate that a full eighty percent of the plot is dedicated to the ingenious, almost miraculous, development of the island's bounty. Our five heroes are the most innovative of castaways; nothing is beyond them. During their time on the island they have the know-how & resources to produce bricks, pottery, ironware, gunpowder, nitro-glycerene, etc. etc., even introducing a telegraph system & no detail is spared in the descriptions of each operation. As a consequence the book reads like a cross between Handyman's Journal, Construction Weekly & Farming Monthly.The castaways are a deadly boring bunch. They quickly become firm friends; respectful, tolerant & pass their time in mutual hero-worship & devotion. They are such a 'hail-fellow & well met' group that there is a complete absence of any sort of jealousy, resentment, discontent or moaning; indeed a complete absence of any emotional excitement.There is a mystery involved but I didn't feel it worth the effort of wading through the massive amount of technical details to find out the end result.Look here for blandness & do-it-yourself tips; look elsewhere for adventure.",2,0
"This is the second book in the Dragon Town Trilogy.  The first book is Snapdragon Alley and the last is Dragon Town.  In this book, Argus, the 3-year-old from the first book, is a 22 year old man with a quiet life.  He is quiet and depressed, estranged from his family, an lives with a group of roommates that he doesn't really interact with.  He doesn't remember the experiences of the summer that took place in the first book.  One day, he is handed a mysterious package.  Those around him are intrigued, and everyone joins together to try to solve the clues.The tone of the book is fairly dark, and you keep hoping for a better 'Happily ever After' for the characters from the first book than is portrayed here.  But this is only the second book in the series - perhaps there is more to come.In writing about a book series that Argus is reading, this author writes ""They were genuine mystery novels, where the mystery often remains mysterious, unlike most books of that type, which should really be called 'solution' novels because there is rarely any mystery left at the end.""  That description is certainly true of the first two books in this series.  I'm definitely left mystified and wondering.  And yet, I'm not disappointed.  I don't feel that the plot was left hanging.  And somehow, I don't think I will be disappointed even if the last book in the series leaves me with the same sense of wonder - plotting and turning around all of my different theories in my mind.",4,1

However, it was atually longer than many of the ""novellas"" I've purchaed via amazon's kindle for your PC, brilliant idea by the way guys, i.e. making kindle ebooks available for other electronic devices.The author provides just enough character development given the expected limitations of any novella.  Given the aforementioned constraint, I recommend this as a fun read at a fairly appropriate price.  I plan to read the rest of this series despite the poor reviews the 1st book in the series received.  I truly appreciate the reviews but ultimately I make my own decision regarding whether I  purchase a particular book & so should everyone.  Besides, AMAZON'S CSR IS SO FAITHFUL TO IT READERS THAT UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WILL AT LEAST GIVE ONE A CREDIT TOWARD ANOTHER PURCHASE IF A CUSTOMER IS TRULY UNHAPPY WITH AN EBOOK PURCHASE.

"Lately, I have been devouring Laura Lippman novels; I think her stand-alone books are outstanding examples of psychological suspense. So, I was mighty pleased when I saw I could download one of her short stories for my Kindle...for free. And, now that I've read it, I'm shaking my head and wondering, ""Did I miss something?"" I actually flipped the page when I got to the end, expecting the story to go on (and no, I did not expect a novel, but maybe a twist or at least some kind of resolution). When it didn't, I felt cheated. The set up was great, the characters artfully drawn, and the story itself had great potential. But from where I sit, it seems Lippman abandoned the potential and just stopped writing, rather than going to the effort of finishing the story in a satisfying way. The sad thing is, her publishers probably released this short as enticement to buy THE BABYSITTER'S CODE. I fear it will have the opposite effect.",2,0

They both start falling for eachother....and of course there is a ""misunderstanding"" when she sneaks out in the middle of the night but they work it out and all is well",4,1
"The civil war was hard on all sides, but mainly the poor widowed women left behind.  That is the preface of this story and how two people come together fighting their own demons and end up falling in love.  It is an enjoyable read.",4,1
"I just love these old mysteries and Freeman's are not as slow moving nor as  lugubrious and verbose as others. For myself, I find they are an easy read; that is, beautifully written, engaging and enjoyable.I especially liked the short stories and Helen Vardon and did not find the typos to be onerous, not finding above half a dozen in the last full-length novel. I am definitely going to be acquiring more of this author's work.  Thank you Amazon for making these pieces available and at such reasonable prices. In fact, many are free!!",5,1
"Not for me.  When I think, J.A. Konrath, I think of an author who has successfully gone Indie.  So I was hoping for some insightful information and practical advice for an Indie author.  Instead, I came up short, which is rather spectacular since this is about 370,000 words!!!  This is a compilation of blog posts and it is seriously outdated.  Has the publishing world changed so quickly?  I guess it has.  I mean he has several chapters about MYSPACE!!  Much of this is geared toward an author who already has a publishing deal or an agent and the rest would have been helpful 5 years ago. So for an Indie like myself, this was a waste of time.",1,0
I enjoyed this book. This book gave my emotions a run for their money.  Really loved the four winds being together.,4,1
"Meli Galdes is ready to retire. She's dedicated her life to her family as an assassin and kinsmen, using her genetically enhanced skills as a melder. Her world is a tough one, where greed and power go hand in hand with the abilities of the kinsmen. Her family has one last request of Meli, however, one that will send her back into her past memories. Can Meli kill Celino Carvanna, the man who broke her heart and set her on her current course?Ilona Andrews crafts a darkly alluring world in which death and assassination are merely par for the course in the business world. I wasn't sure how I'd like such a bleak and harsh world, but Ilona Andrews does a marvelous job at pitting the characters against their world. Meli and Celino have fought their own inner demons and sought to find their own ways in a world where the family decides everything. It's hard not to admire those traits in them, even as their mindset about killing is so foreign to me.SILENT BLADE is an unusual story. Ilona Andrews takes a seemingly unlikable world and concept and makes it both sensuous and likable. I can only hope that this is the start of a series as I want to see more of the world of the kinsmen! Highly recommended!COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES",4,1
"I liked this short read a lot. The story moves along (besides it being short) and there's nothing happening thatisn't relative to the story.I also liked it because it was creepy without being stupid or a blood/gore splatter fest. I could not guess the endfrom the beginning which is always good in my opinion.Just an all around good creep book.. Like a story you'd tell while camping to scare the kids.The only bad thing is that it was short. The characters could have been developed a bit more if it was longer.Then again, that might have made it worse and perhaps the author knew best. I was just enjoying it enoughthat I didn't want it to end.",4,1
"I was rather disappointed in this book. The writing--as far as vivid descriptions and sentence structure--was okay. The over all plot wasn't really that bad either. The problem was that it was set in the early 1800s, yet the vocabulary used (mainly referring to that for body parts and sex acts) didn't fit the century at all - way too modern. Why bother to research and use proper dialect and setting descriptors/situations elsewhere only to jolt the reader back to the 21st century with modern vernacular?  As far as I'm concerned, this book was a spaghetti bowl of sex tossed on top of a shaky frame of a plot by and author who could decide which century she was in.",2,0

"RATING = 3.5 STARSIn From Afar we see two very different kinds of vampires.  There is Raphael who has chosen to live apart from the local vampire clan and their indulgent, violent lifestyle. Because of his choice, he is forced to live a lonely life apart from both human and vampiric society. The clan vampires, all male, live together under the rule of a single female vampire, Katerina.  All but two of the vampires in the clan have been turned by Katerina and therefore they belong to her.  Since Raphael was not turned by the female vampire he has no loyalties to her and although it may be dangerous for him, he chooses loneliness over the clan.When Raphael rescues Aleric from a vicious late night attack in an alley he is torn. Should he allow the man he's loved from afar for years to die as a result of his injuries, or risk his own life by challenging Katerina's authority in turning Aleric into a vampire and dooming him to a life he himself has long suffered?I really felt for Raphael.  His loneliness came through so clearly and when presented with a chance at possible happiness, he was torn between his need for the man he loved and the fear of losing him forever either in death or the chance that Aleric would hate him for turning him into a Vampire.  He was forced to make a choice that would change everything, not knowing if that would be for worse or better.I admit I was distrustful of Aleric early on in his relationship with Raphael. Before being turned, Aleric had not yet fully come to terms with his attraction to men. I worried that he was drawn to Raphael more because of the vulnerability he felt in his new vampire nature and was concerned he would eventually hurt or betray Raphael once he became more at ease with his new life as a vampire. Wondering if he would proclaim his love for Raphael or leave him in favor of clan life kept me on the edge of my seat.My only problem with From Afar was the unexpected ending.  I was engrossed in the story and looking forward to reading about how Aleric and Raphael would overcome their problems with Katerina and the clan vampires and was a little surprised when the story came to an end.Ava March is an author that I will most certainly want to read more from.  Her writing style easily drew me into this paranormal Regency Era romance  from the very beginning. The romantic relationship in From Afar was convincing, tugged at my heart strings, and left me wanting more.",3,1
"I've read some of Tina Folsom's Scanguards series and found them entertaining, so I thought I'd give this series a try. Tina may craft a good story, but she should stay out of historical eras if she's not going to do the research. The language between the characters was modern and sometimes ridiculous. I get the feel the location and time were only a vehicle for erotica, so if that's your thing, you may enjoy them. I didn't.",1,0
"Jack Kilborn AKA J.A. Konrath is one of my favorite authors. When I noticed he had a new book out that happened to be a FREE internet short story I had to have it. I downloaded it immediately.Jack collaborated with Blake Crouch and came up with this disturbing short story. About a man who picks up hitchhikers and murders them as well as a hitchhiker that goes around hitching rides and gruesomely murdering her drivers.It's disturbing and gruesome and amazing. How they created this is beyond me. It's really a good book. Well written and surprising to the end.I must say though, it's not for those with a weak stomach. SO beware.",5,1

"Although WSJ has good reporting and covers all the news, the price keeps going up.  I often buy alternatives due to the inflated price.  I don't think the Kindle version of WSJ is that much better than other sources of financial news (Financial Times, for example) to justify the price difference.",3,1
While the plot had promise the story just didn't deliver. The characters were more caricature than realistic. The story appeared to be a more of cross between Pretty Woman and a fairy tale than a contemporary romance.,2,0
"Why is it that these great newspapers cannot figure out the digital format?  The kindle versions frequently are stripped down versions without photos and charts and in many cases without some of the sections.  Do they really think that people want to pay for that.  There are too many free news sources that can accomplish this level of news.  If they really want to get subscribers to pay, they need to provide a newspaper experience (some people even like the ads!!)  The new Kindle version of the New York Times is an example of an improved newspaper experience where the kindle version has even more pictures than the paper in some cases (this is what digital can excel at).  The times still has its weaknesses but its an improvement.  The Post is still not worth buying digitally.",3,1
This book wasn't bad for a freebie. Typical plot for the genre with average characters is my opinion.  Take the chance.,3,1
"This book was good in most ways, but extremely predictable which is not what you want when reading a murder mystery novel.",4,1
"ok so the reason I gave this book 4.5 stars, was because it was too short... Otherwise  this story was FREAKING HOT!! but, BEWARE if you are not into menage, or guy on guy then this book might just not be the one you want to read. Its super steamy and sexy and blew me away with the sex scenes. I think this  author really did a great job on writing this story. It was extremely creative, and who would have thought a game like that would bring them together. This book was super cute, In the beginning Charlie didn't realize how she felt about the men who have been in her life for many years, they scared away the men she brought home, interrogated them whenever she brought dates to dinner, and it just never occurred to her that they might all have feelings for her. one of the guys she has a strong connection to his name is Simon and he seems like he has always been in love with her. Her and Simon have the strongest connection compared to the other two men. Then there is Rafael and Eric, and they both have liked each other (the men) and they just never hooked up because they didn't want to ruin what they had with Charlie. Until this cruise happened, they never tried anything with each other, and when it finally happens and they take chances and risks, Charlie gets scared and runs away. But will she realize that she has wanted them all along? Will they realize that she was the connection to all of them being able to love each other? READ this book and find out, i promise you wont regret it, it will make you HOTT!! make sure you have a fan handy!LOL",5,1
"The book begins when Morgan, a small town doctor, meets Luke, a drifter with a baby. The baby is the result of a random one-night stand with a waitress/prostitute, and has been left in Luke's care. Morgan, knowing nothing about Luke, invites both he and the baby back to his derelict farm. From there, the author pieced together several random scenes where Morgan and Luke interact, yet there is no character development, and no real sense that these characters are building a connection.Luke is not gay, and Morgan just wanders around the farm ogling him. Basically, Luke just decides to let Morgan kiss/touch him, and boom, they're messing around. Luke had no real personal dilemma or journey to this conclusion. The sex scenes seemed to be written by someone who doesn't actually know how gay men have sex.Overall, this ""novel"" was so poorly crafted - all I can say is DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.",1,0

"Very well done.  Through the reading, Duke and Mav were the epitome of str8te acting sports jocks who think nothing of a slap on the butt or pinching other guys nipples. As long as your eyes don't go below the waistline, then you're safe in the lockerroom. It was realistic in that sense and even the confrontation in the drug store with the homophobe would have made a str8te boy blush.  A Very good read!",5,1

"I'd never read works by this writer before and was pleasantly surprised.  I am a big fan of comfortable writing styles. If you've read any of my other reviews, I use that term a lot. This story was an enjoyable read and I plan on hitting up more of her books.",4,1
"Disclaimer: I got this for my Kindle when it was being given away for free.  It now is up to $2.80 but my review takes into account what I paid.I like Markhat the finder, a hard-boiled ex-military gumshoe in a fantasy land where trolls, vampires, and other creatures of the night interact with humans.  This novella/short story has some great dialog and I truly wish it had been longer.  I even paid $2.00 for another Markhat book, The Mister Trophy, hoping for more of the same and while it was equally as good as this book it was also equally as short.  If I consider the combined content of both books and consider the $2 I paid for them, I still rate them 5 stars.Apparently there is a third, longer Markhat book out now which for some reason isn't available for the Kindle.  Come on Frank, what are you and Samhain waiting for?",5,1

I wouldnt even want a friend to read this if i wrote it! N to say I was not looking for a mind blower here but some intense eroctica...well this was plain bad! Written in short sentences, like a primate or 3rd grader wrote it. Worst off I could of written this on an off day, fuled up on coffee, n little sleep.

"First off the it took me months to finish this book.  I am OCD so I had to finish it unwillingly!  Right off the bat, how can anyone fall in love with a guy who from day one treats you like your are the scourge of the earth!? First he kidnaps you, then the day following your kidnapping, since his housekeeper/cook is not there in the morning, you make him breakfast because gee you're so nice and sweet.  Oh, there's more, afterwards you make out with him after her forces a kiss on you because you find his witty insults so irresistible!! To make this love story even better he offers you to be his mistress but feeling insulted you deny him.  Oh wait, then you give your virginity like after 4 days of knowing him, because he took you horse back riding, and snorkeling while the whole time he insulted you saying that you're a conniving gold digger!!  Oh, that's right Stockholm syndrome!!  After he takes your virginity he believes you and lets you call your twin which is the one to marry his brother. But loll and behold, he still doesn't believe you're better than a conniving gold digger and you're only good to be his mistress, yet you gave him your virginity because he's sooooo irresistible!!That's why it took me months to finish this book.  I wanted to kill both of the main characters, I saw no redeeming qualities for Nikias and Diona was just wrong in the head.  The story doesn't end there, but I will not continue writing about it because it just ticks me off.  Anyways, back to my review; the author needs help editing, usage of words, periods and comas.  I have noticed also that a lot of writers don't seem to know that woman is the singular and women is the plural of the word (I had to say it, it's just one of those things that really bug me about the grammar) NO I would not recommend this book not even to my worst enemy, and NO I won't be reading anything else from this writer.",1,0
"I like erotica well enough but this was billed more as erotic romance. There was nothing romantic about it. This is kind of sci fi as its set in the future a bit where there is an kind sex Olympics and sex is a talent that you can go to school to get good at. The world building in this book simply was not good. The hero was a Twit. I have no idea why the heroine would be in love with him.Most of all, it felt soulless.  And ick. Yep, ick. Not sexy.  I can't recommend even for those who like harder core erotica.I was given this book for my honest review. So, there you have it.",1,0
"I loved this book, I loved that characters were imperfect, I loved chemistry between them, but the main reason I am writing here is because I wanted to share just how much I hated one of the characters (not sure if it was desired effect or not, but hey one cannot help how one feels). Please feel free to stop reading, since it is sort of a rant that book just made me think of, it has nothing to do with the merits of the story, or maybe it does  have something to do with author's writing talent, since it invoked such strong feelings in me and only a good writer can do it  :).I hated Jae's editor, but hey I am biased, I have no relation to any celebrities, gay or straight lol, but I despise tabloid journalism, I despise it with passion. I think that even celebrity has their right to privacy and the person who destroys it is a vulture. But I warned you, I despise tabloid journalism, I am not interested in celebrities' marriages, divorces, affairs, etc, I know a lot of people eat this stuff with the spoon, I just really ignore these magazines.SPOILERS to follow, even though very minor ones, since the names of the characters which I am referring to are not the names of two lead characters.So since I happen to think that what happened to Hunter is completely a fault of this guy and his magazine, well, I was ready to slap Vega when he went into his self righteous rant about people like Hunter hurting people.Anyway, great story, thank you!",5,1

"Originally Posted at: [...]Dark, mysterious and oh so sexy. Those are only a few words I can use to describe Trigg, a vampire who has sworn to protect civilization from the rogues of his kind.After escaping years of abuse from Jack, the last thing Robyn was looking for was another man trying to control her, yet that is exactly what she got. Who wouldn't want to take care of a starving, visibly abused female like Robyn? Trigg only wanted to make her evening a little easier by purchasing her a real meal, but that one meal turned into a lifetime.Your heart will immediately go out to Robyn in this story. I was a little concerned that the love story was about an eighteen year-old, because that seemed a little too young in my mind but it worked well since Robyn was forced to grow up fast due to the abuse she lived with. I also enjoyed the way her previous circumstances made her adapt to Trigg and the other Watchers' way of life easily.Trigg, like many men in these types of novels, is your typical Alpha male. He would have to be in order to be a Watcher for his kind. Only around Robyn can he allow himself to show his softer side. So between Robyn's need for protection, and his need to loosen up, they come together wonderfully.The plot line was phenomenal. The way everything tied in together was perfect. The story was constantly moving forward and kept me turning page after page. It's one of those books where you say to yourself this is the last chapter I'll read, but yet you keep going until you realize you've read the entire book. It also sets you up perfectly for the next book in the series which I cannot wait to read.This was a great love story between two well-deserving characters that you definitely do not want to miss. I highly recommend Midnight Reborn.",5,1

After having just finished a book that was full of typos & misused words, this one was a pleasure to at least not have that to contend with.I found the story to be just so-so; I really wasn't on the edge of my seat ever, and found myself wishing it would just be over. In fact, it was actually a bit hard to try to follow. When the end finally came it was just a relief.

"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogBianca D'Arc takes readers into an alternate world where dragons exist. In this unique world, dragons are bounded to their knights in a way that makes them both experience what the other is feeling. When Bolera, a fair maiden goes out to hunt a stag for some food for her family, she comes across a huge dragon named Kelvan who tries to steal her latest game. As they argue over who made the kill, they decide to see Sir Gareth, the dragon's knight to settle this matter.Bolera and Sir Gareth experience an instant attraction to one another. Sometimes I felt that the dialogue between the characters was a tad bit cheesy, but this book does have a fairy tale feel to it. Their romance blooms, and soon Gareth wishes to make Bolera his for eternity. The mating rituals for the dragon knights are very different. Going into this book I knew there would be m&eacute;nage in it, but in the first half of the book, the three major characters are Bolera, Sir Gareth and Kelvan, the dragon. For a second there, I thought she was going to have sex with the dragon! But no, fear not...there's none of that in this book. :)This is where Lars enters. Lars is the knight that is bounded to Kelvan's new mate. Since dragon and their knights are connected on a visceral level, when a knight finds his mate, the dragon is now able to mate as well. So since Gareth found his new wife is Bolera, Kelvan can now find his own mate. Kelvan's new dragon mate also has her own knight, Lars. Lars feels the erotic pull through his bound with the dragons and soon, he can't resist the urge either.Essentially, if the bound goes right, Bolera, Sir Gareth and Lars will all be mated while still being connected to their newly mated dragons as well. Together, they make their own family. While complicated at first, this story was a very unique take on dragons. I don't think I've read any dragon book so deliciously intricate.There's also a great introduction to the next book in the series, which will feature Bolera's mother, Adora. Despite my initial hesitation about this series, I think I enjoy the world enough to read more about it!*ARC provided by publisher",4,1

"Eastern Texas, 1879At the age of five, Emma Radcliff made the monumental announcement that she is going to marry Rafe Sinclair.  She's done a lot of growing up in the fifteen years since then and has decided that she's not going to marry at all.  Wearing breeches and working horses on her father's ranch suits her just fine.  Only her plans are thwarted when her father insists that she marry Rafe - no if's, and's, or but's.Rafe Sinclair really has no interest in getting married but a stipulation in his grandfather's will forces the issue.  He has to be married by the time he turns thirty or he loses the Circle S Ranch.  Since he's known Emma her entire life she seems like a relatively safe choice but the last thing he anticipates is the little hellcat's insistence that he agree to stay out of her bed.  To make matters worse, little Emma is looking mighty gown up and he's just discovered that he wants her - in every way.Since Emma insists on her no sex clause, Rafe counters her with a clause of his own - that she reserves the right to change her mind and void her clause at any time.  Though still not entirely comfortable with the situation Emma agrees but also requests that she be allowed to work with the horses at the Triple R. They'll both have what they want - well almost.  Things don't go exactly according to plan.  Emma's father refuses to allow her to return to work the horses after the marriage takes place, she counterattacks with the insistence that she takes some of the horses with her.Rafe and Emma marry but no sooner are the vows spoken then the trouble starts.  Emma's always been very attracted to Rafe and Rafe is definitely finding it difficult to adhere to her `no marital privileges' clause.  What's a guy to do when he discovers that is new wife is the sexiest thing on two legs?  Well being a man of his word, he can't just grab her up and take her to his bed, he's going to have to seduce her.  Only Emma's just as stubborn as he is persuasive.  Which one will hold out the longest?Beth Williamson presents readers with yet another wonderful historical tale with her contribution to the LEATHER AND LACE series - BRANDED.  Emma won me over from the very first page.  She's so `in-your-face' and not afraid to go against convention that I couldn't wait to read all about her and find out how or even if Rafe can `tame' her.  Rafe grew up knowing Emma so of course he's never seen her in any sort of sexual way but he's seeing her now and practically salivating just thinking about bedding his own wife.  Ms. Williamson even throws in several supporting characters that you'll love to hate or hate to love, but in either case they're definitely unique and fun.Be sure to keep an eye out for the other LEATHER AND LACE series books.

"I enjoyed the premise of this story. The storyline however was a bit too abrupt for my taste. Because it was a novella, the story moves fast but seems like it leaves out a lot. The beginning of the story makes you feel like you're coming into something where the back story must have been given 50 pages prior. I'd love to see this book and the rest of the series as a full length novel. For now I'll just take this as a taste of what Ms. Teshco has to offer.",3,1
This short story lacks the heat of the Shadowlands Masters series but for the price (free) it was a nice quick read.  Nothing to rave about with limited sex scenes and baffling motivations.,3,1
"Overly sexual (with no reason, and it adds nothing to the plot line) with no point, and not at all scarry.",1,0
"I agree with the other reviewer that wrote that this story reads like a 70s porn. And I really think it was written by a guy, because I don't know any woman that would fantasize about the stuff in here.In addition, it was ridiculously short, and even with that there were proofreading errors:""His hands reaches up and caressed by titties..."" and line spacing where it shouldn't be.",1,0
The book was free and I was looking for something to read so the book (not even a book) was way too short.  Just when it started to get good it ended.  It should have been just a little longer with a decent ending (personally I don't enjoy books with no ending).,3,1
"Sheridan ""Sheri"" Montgomery is a puma who also has albinoism (her definition - not an albino), she is also a victim of abuse by her boyfriend a wolf shifter who attacked her. She was injured so severely that Max Cannon, a friend turned her into a puma to help her recover from her injuries. Along with her albinoism, she is legally blind. After being found whenever she moved she finally contacts Max to ask for help from him and his pride of pumas.Sheri has just moved to Halle and is working part time for the mates of the Alpha and Beta, but she needs to be introduced to the pride and approved as a pride member. Adam Giordano the pride Marshall is delegated to give her a ride to the pride meeting, as soon as he sees and scents her he realizes that she is his mate, Sheri realizes the same thing but both of them deny their feelings - of course that doesn't last for long.Sheri's attacker has followed her to Halle, Max the puma leader contacts the Alpha wolf from the Poconos pack for help against the rogue wolf and his small pack, Sheri is guarded and Adrain steps up to make sure she is protected by him - her mate. Sheri knows that Adrian will be attacked when the crazy wolf realizes they are together.The plotline for this was tight and very well conceived, the action is still limited by the length of the book but I liked this story very much. Especially the viewpoint from Sheri as an albino.Again a great series -not dark and brooding.",5,1
This short story didn't have a purpose. I wouldn't recommend reading unless you are extremely bored. I gave it a 2 because I didn't find any grammatical errors like some books I have read.,2,0
"This book is a so-called ""classic,"" having been written in the late 1800's.  I have to say I was disappointed in it.  The characters are very one-dimensional.  Phoebe is good.  Hiram is  bad.  Phoebe's brother is  wishy-washy, and his wife is a witch.  I cannot understand why Phoebe sticks around being everyone's favorite doormat once she turns 18 and is legally released from her brother's guardianship.There were strong female protagonists created by other authors in the same time period, so the lack of complexity in Phoebe's character cannot be completely explained by time and place.  If you are interested in reading novels of this era, I highly recommend those written by Anna Katharine Green.  Green's characters are much more fully drawn, and the stories more satisfying.",3,1

"I don't really know what to say about this story. If you're a fan of zombie books then get it. It's a pretty quick read and it'll satiate your bloodlust for a little while. My only problem was that the characters were a little uninteresting. Other than that, it was pretty good.",3,1
"I had never read any of the Oz books except the Wonderful WIzard of Oz.  I'd seen the Judy Garland movie several times and frankly gotten a little tired of it.  I'd seen a TV movie with new characters but had not realized there were further adventures actually written by Baum.  These are written for children but everything is so fresh and new they are great fun reads for adults, too.  I'm only part way through the entire collection but am having a great time following Dorothy's adventures in the different worlds.  Not all take place in Oz - so far, I've traveled to Ev (across the great desert from Oz) and a land underground inhabited by people who are vegetables and not particularly nice ones.",4,1
"The sample chapters clearly show that the author can write well, promising a tale of daring and creative revenge in the spirit of The Count of Monte Cristo. There was even a point early in the story where I was rubbing my hands together with glee because it seemed like the villain was going to unwittingly hire the alter ego of the man trying to assassinate him to track down the man trying to assassinate him. And that was gonna be awesome to watch!Unfortunately, this was only one of the really amazing potential plot twists that just failed to materialize - hinted at and then just dropped. If the author had lavished as much attention on the middle and end of the book as he clearly did on the beginning, City of Rogues could have been so much more than just another fantasy novel with familiar tropes, stock characters, and modest world-building.It's not a bad story, mind you, but I can't help but feel it could have been so much better if the author had made some bolder plot choices.",3,1
"When I read the beginning of this book I thought it sounded like a good urban romance, with a little bit of the paranormal thrown in.  Wrong!  There was a sketchy amount of story tucked around an enormous amount of graphic sex.  Not my thing, not what I expected.  Too many questions left unanswered, too many characters left dangling, but you get what you pay for.  I would have preferred a better developed plot and less sex.  I will not be reading any more of this author's work, and I'm sorry I read this.",1,0
"Typos aside, I thought the idea and the general plot was good. The main character is pretty awesome and leads the story well enough. Unfortunately, from the beginning I felt like this was the 2nd or 3rd book of a series. The background is sort of filled in eventually, but it takes almost the entire book to do so, including the 'bonus story.'While I do love the characters Count and Kara, everything else about the book was difficult to follow and enjoy. The flow of the plot was not smoothe. The other characters seemed unfinished. I don't normally mind being thrown in the middle of a setting with gradual background information released as I read, but the author did a poor job of intergrating the reader into his world at a good pace. The beginning was very busy and had a lot going on, only as a recap in his hospital stay, and THEN the reader is put into the present time, which is slow moving. The bonus story felt like another ""how I met this other character"" mini story that was put in at random fillers during the plot.Count and Kara are good characters. The others need more polish. The book as a whole seemed completely unorganized. The idea for this magical world and its characters is great, but it's poorly executed.",3,1
"This was not a book at all! It starts out about a woman who has a thriving floral business. At the peek time of her business, her flower keeper was called away on a family emergency, and as an answer to her prayer, a man lives nearby who has experience as a keeper & she considers him a God~send, from there things move very quickly to the sudden ending. Glad this was free!",2,0
"I bought this based on all the wonderful reviews.  So I feel obligated to post my opinion since I had a very different reading experience.I was looking for a nice little sci-fi erotica novella and instead got written porn.  It was pages and pages of sex with no emotion build up. No emotional investment or interest for me as a reader in the characters. (Literally she opens the door the H says hello, doesn't even introduce himself and within half a page the first sex scene starts.) On top of that I found that there was no real character development - the H starts out wanting to make the H love him and with a tendency to be sexually /emotionally dominant. The h is not all that likeable, closed off and bratty  - but she amazingly goes from this to letting him get ""into"" all her emotional shields in a day and a half with what can only be the sex..... As for the plot I was hard pressed to find one, his trying to get her love??????The sad thing was, there was so much potential in this little novella: an emotionally scarred heroine who in a last ditch effort orders a custom husband who comes out with some ""extras"" from her Christmas shopping list, a hero hoping for love, a loving family, and interfering friends intent on making her happy that could have played lots of hijinks on the road to happily ever after - instead of just being mentioned.If you need story, plot, or characters with any depth I would suggest skipping this one. If on the other had you're in the mood for a hot little read and don't mind the use of tentacles this might be your book.",1,0

"A historical ""romance"", religious, and based in the time of Jesus, the brief synopsis was not necessarily misleading in as much as it left out key compenents that would have swayed my decision. Had I paid for the book, I likely would have wanted a refund. But, as it stands, it was a freebie, and so I cant complain too much.It wasnt until just after half way that I realized who the reference in the title was, and it became clear that I was NOT going to get what I expected from the book.I am not a big fan of religious books written in this way. I much prefer to keep the bible seperate in that the stories of the bible, specifically the death of Jesus, be left as they are.The story did not set well with me, and though it had an HEA, it still left a bad taste in my mouth.Having said all that, the historical aspects were well researched and the technical aspects of the authors writing style was spot on. I walked away feeling like I learned something about the time period that I didnt know before and in a way that was almost poetic.If you are looking for steam, look elsewhere. But if you enjoy religious novels that adapt stories from the bible, you might enjoy this book.",2,0
"A big cultural gaffe towards the end of the book brought the star rating down for me.The woman, Danielle, is marrying a sheikh so obviously he must be Muslim. According to the author, at the wedding to be held in his homeland they will be married by a priest. She mentioned the priest several times while discussing the wedding in Basir.I can overlook certain things in these books but in this day and age of Internet where information is at your fingertips, a quick search would have revealed the wedding would have been performed by a ma'zeen or imam.Apart from that, the story was enjoyable and the hunky sheikh is a hottie!",3,1

The last half of the book was worthy of a 5 star book and I'm looking forward to the next book in the trilogy, hoping it will be a true 5 star all the way from start to finish.I enjoyed the book and the characters and the action.

"Belinda `Belle' Campbell has had more than her fair share of pain - both mentally and physically.  She's been practically ostracized by many of the members of the Halle pride and injured severely enough to require a steel pin in her leg - which means that she can't shapeshift until they're removed.  The last thing she needs is more complications but that's exactly what she gets in the form of an Alpha wolf named Rick Lowell.Rick Lowell is the Alpha of the Red Wolf Poconos Pack.  He isn't exactly having an easy go of things here lately.  He's been shot, killed a rogue, found his mate, learned of her injuries, and now been told that he cannot take her home.  Why? Because she's Puma and the Wolf pack has to be prepared to accept a non-Wolf Luna.  He could handle all that but throw in an uppity dominant female looking to take over as Luna and things are bound to get very interesting.Belle has no doubt that Rick is her mate but she's not a push over and he's a little too full of himself for her taste.  Besides her doctors are in Halle and therefore she'll be staying put for the time being - possibly until the pin in her leg can be removed.  Rick's not willing to wait that long though, once the cast comes off he wants her with him - and it will still be another six months before she'll be able to shift.Belle's all for starting her life at Rick's side but she's not at all ready to take on Gina and her demands for full protocol.  Fortunately Belle isn't afraid to fight for what's hers and if that means taking on one conniving bitch then she'll use every means at her disposal to ensure that she comes out on top.  Rick is aware of just how devious Gina is and he's willing to take whatever steps necessary to ensure that Belle's transition into the pack is as smooth as possible and that she be allowed to recuperate before facing Gina and her challenge.  He shouldn't have worried.  Even being unable to shift, Belle is more than capable of facing down Gina and she does it with such style that you'll be left with no doubt that this `cat' is far superior to the `dog.'  Belle's the perfect match for Rick, but what will happen when Gina's plans push Rick and Belle into making decisions that could have disastrous results?Just when I thought the HALLE PUMA series couldn't get any better, it does!  STEEL BEAUTY is the fourth book in this delightful series and revisiting these characters is a pleasure you won't want to pass up.  This story is infused with humor, some real kick butt action, a memorable romance and proof that cats and dogs can be friends - and so much more. Belle won me over with her `in your face' attitude and the hilarious way she taunts Gina - as well as Rick.  She's not a gal who's going to let anyone get away with anything and I adore that about her.  Rick is exactly the sort of man Belle needs, he's just got to learn to share problems and worries - and she is chock full of ways of ensuring that he doesn't forget that she is his life partner.If you haven't read the other titles in this series, I'd highly recommend doing so - not because it's necessary to understand this book but because they're delightfully fun.

"THIS IS A WARNING TO ANYONE THINKING ABOUT READING THIS SERIES. THIS SERIES CONTAINS REFERENCE TO, AND IN THE FINAL BOOK, AN ENTIRE STORY REVOLVING AROUND INCEST.This first book in the series is just basically an introduction to the series, and contained no reference to incest, but the second book did. I bought the other three books in the series based solely on this book, because I liked Sonny and Garron and wanted to find out how their story progressed. References to the incestuous relationship between Sonny's identical twin brothers starts in the second book, and through character thoughts and conversations, the author makes it clear that the relationship is long-term (going back to childhood), consensual, and accepted without a murmur by the rest of the family and apparently the entire town. I found this beyond disturbing, and promptly returned the entire series for a refund.After returning them, I went back and read the book descriptions more thoroughly, but beyond a vaguely worded comment in the description of the fourth book, none of them carry any kind of warning that these books contain sensitive or disturbing material. I did find references when I read all the reviews of the fourth book, but it should not be up to the readers to warn others about things like this. That should be responsibility of the publishers and Amazon. That even the fourth book, which deals directly with the incestuous relationship, carried no warning whatsoever is completely unacceptable.So I'm putting this warning on the first book in the series, before people get involved with the characters and their stories. I will also be reading the descriptions and every single review for any books I consider purchasing from this author in the future.",1,0

"Elena O'Rourke is the junior probationary police detective on the third shift, pining desperately to make full detective status, when the body of Napoleon Shrimpf falls into her lap - metaphorically. Dubbed by Elena to be The Case of the Punctured Prick, she scrambles to solve the crime as she struggles to maintain her rep as a competent cop's daughter (WWDD - What Would Daddy Do - a mantra of hers) amid the frustrations of an unwanted and criminally chatty partner and under the attentions of the sexiest male she's ever seen, Bo Strongwell. And despite the fact that Bo keeps turning up to turn her on and she wants nothing more than solving her case AND ending an achingly long sexual drought (not necessarily in that order), he's a suspect, and puts the suspicious in ""suspicious character.""Strongwell wants nothing more than to protect his town and his...people...until he gets his first taste of Elena, and then the Vikingesque vamp can't get enough of her scent and her taste and HER. But secrets divide them, and as he tries to protect Elena AND keep his true identity hidden, his growing lust and affection may draw her into a deadly threat - not only to her life, but to the future of the whole town.I have to say, I liked Bite My Fire. I thought the plot was engaging and the vampire mythos seemed original enough not to come across as a tired revamping (no pun intended). The setting, Meiers Corners, is chock full of quirky and pop-iconic tertiary characters (like the town gossip and hair cutting maven, Dolly Barton, and the CSI agent whose initials are CSI and who bears a startling resemblance to William Peterson...and for those Buffy aficionados, the vamp prostitute, Drusilla) who add a definite flavor to the mix. And too, while I didn't find it laugh-out-loud funny, I certainly found it humorous enough to make me smile quite a bit through the reading of it. But there were some problems...Most notably, I had some issues with the two lead characters. Written in first person from Elena's point of view, I couldn't seem to truly warm to her and thought too much of her character was defined by her hormones, not enough by her intelligence. I'm all for a lusty lead, but when it's the driving personality trait and to such an extent as it was in Bite My Fire, the character seems a bit too two dimensional. It's a pity, too, because there was definitely enough backstory provided to give her some depth - with the history of her parents and connection to her sister - but she focused SO much on her sexuality that it muffled all the rest. And Bo was little more than a cardboard cutout of hunky male yumminess. Again, I like me some hot male vamp, but if it's the only aspect of him we really see, it makes it hard to see him as a full person. And this was particularly jarring during a scene at the end, when he seemed to do a complete about face from tall, blonde, sexy, and mysterious to earnest family man wannabe.Ah, but I said MOST notably. I had other issues as well. Personally, I think this book would've benefited from some critical editing - not to fix errors, but to pare down and streamline the story itself. I felt the beginning, pre-Elena finding out about vampires, went on far too long. I also think what started as a shiny glitter of amusing and quirky characters dragged straight into repetition and ended up bordering tedium. Detective Dirk, for example, started out as a cute character and quickly got on my nerves real fast. As did Elena's fleeing from him. In fact, I'd say overall I would've preferred a bit more focus on character development and the relationship between Elena and Bo, and there would've been plenty of room for that if everything that happened 3-4 times (or more) in the book had been pared down to 1-2 times (including evading Detective Dirk, confrontations with Elena's sister, descriptions of every nuance of Bo's body, and the many many reminders of how long it'd been since Elena had last had sex). Also, I had one other slightly odd issue that I can't remember having in the many paranormal romance/urban fantasy series I read. I thought the vampire mythos in this book was a bit vague and anorexic in definition. What WAS there SEEMED sort of new and potentially fresh, but there really was so little explained, and most of that not even by an actual vampire, that I couldn't quite sink my teeth into it (pun intended). The lack left that aspect of the world far less clear in my mind than the setting, and as it's a vampire paranormal, I think that's a problem.All that being said, I did like the book and I'm going to be readingBiting Nixie: A Biting Love Novel, which, if I understand correctly, was the first book published, but the second in the timeline of the Biting Love series. I may be wrong about that, though - I'm a bit confused on the point - so don't quote me.",3,1
"I thought the 3rd book in the Men of S.W.A.T. series to be sexy and fun, but not without its problems.  It took a while for me to like a hero who could humiliate our heroine as he did when they were teenagers, then enter into a long-term relationship with our heroine's ""prettier"" sister. There was a good opportunity for Cowboy to redeem himself, but Pip didn't make him work for her or her forgiveness! I didn't think it was very hero-like of Cowboy to take Pip's virginity on the ground behind his truck. And the end was so very frustrating!So why did I give this one 3 stars? The sexual tension was hot, and it features one of the most hilariously funny scenes I've ever read!

She has made me a fan of a new, to me, genre. This is a really great quick read.Robyn Maxwell has a big ski trip planned, but at the last minute her brother, Tad, cancels on her. She decides that she is going with or without him. She is a strong independent woman, and her survival skills are not weakened in the least bit by the fact that she is deaf. Her biggest worry is that she will eat all 6450 calories of the cheesecake she had gotten for her and Tad to enjoy together. The chance to get out of the city and relax in the Yukon wilderness is one thing she can't pass up.Keil and his brother TJ had a nice relaxing weekend planned, before Keil is scheduled to challenge for the Alpha position in his Alaskan Pack. With a fight to the death hanging over his head and watching out for his accident prone brother, the last thing he expected was to find his mate out in the wilderness. OR to have to explain to her that she is a wolf in the first place. Language barriers aside these two have some smoking hot chemistry and sex!! HOLY SMOKES!!I loved this book. It was one of those where it makes you wish you would meet this smoking hot man, with abs for days, and have him tell you that you are his mate. Sign me up for some of that!! This book has some great funny banter between everyone. I really loved the sibling like interactions between Robyn and TJ, and then once the wolf telepathy starts between Robyn and Keil that amps up the hotness level for me. This is really a great book!

"Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsI jumped at the chance to download this little freebie on Kindle. First it is a historical (my favourite romance genre) and two it is an Eloisa James novella (whom I adore) and three A Fool Again is linked to her Duchess Quartet Series which I also loved.So what happened with A Fool Again? I didn't like Genevieve after the first chapter, I was luke warm towards Lucius Felton and I just couldn't understand why the heck why Tobias held a torch for Genevieve after all those years. I mean, he only talked to her for a few hours before they tried to elope to Gretna Green. They were young, perhaps a little drunk but could her beauty really last in his memory for him to pine for her all the years he was in India?Even after Tobias returns from India and moves to reacquaint himself with Genevieve, besides her beauty, what was he seeing that really attracts him?What I did like about A Fool Again was of course Eloisa James' writing. As always, it was wonderful and professional. Even if I wasn't a fan of the story plot, I very much enjoyed reading her style. I did like how she solved the conflict between the characters and I was pleased how it all came together in the end.",2,0

"This Kindle version of Ernest Bramah's Max Carrados stories is a collection of stories originally published in pulp magazines rather than a digital version of a previously published book.  The collection covers the time period of 1914 (the first Max Carrados story, ""The Coin of Dionysius"") through the WWI years into the 1920s.  Very few Carrados mysteries are ""murder mysteries"" but are more likely to deal with fraud, theft and (in the war years) espionage.Although Carrados first appeared as the Sherlock Holmes stories were ending and seven years before the first Lord Peter Wimsey story was published, his stories have a distinct resemblance to both.  The blind detective has Holmesian powers of observation but a more affable personality and affluent lifestyle similar to Wimsey.Modern mystery readers may have some trouble adapting to Bramah's style particularly in the earliest stories.  Even with the Holmes stories, we are accustomed to a detailed exposition of the mystery and some kind of resolution for the characters (i.e., ""the boy and girl got married and had three children"", ""the murderer was tried and executed""). The early Carrados stories just stop.  Yes, the solution is revealed along with Carrados's observations but it can be a bit obscure particularly since modern readers won't be familiar with many aspects of daily life in the early 20th century. It took me awhile to understand ""The Ghost of Massingham Mansions"" since I am not familiar with the lighting or plumbing in use in 1890's apartment buildings.  But it was actually a very effective and touching way to end ""The Ingenious Mr. Spinola"".  Later stories are noticeably different as some do have more detailed endings.This would have been a pleasant enough read if not for a major failure in kindle formatting.  Although the first few and last stories are well formatted, the middle is difficult.  All sense of paragraphing and quotation marks are lost so that it is sometimes hard to tell who is speaking to whom and if it is a character speaking at all.  One later story suddenly appears at the end of another with no chapter break (and then appears again as its chapter in the table of contents).",3,1
"In the midst of the technologically and biologically advanced kinsmen of her home planet, Meli Galdes is a melder. Melders are the rare result of a mutation that in Meli's case permits her to operate an energy ribbon through a bracelet on her wrist, severing anything in its path. For years, Meli's covertly filled the role of family assassin, killing whoever threatens the Galdes' survival. But Meli's tired of killing, and following her latest target, Meli's promised retirement will begin. That is until Celino Cervanna, the ruthless leader of the Cervanna family, ensured their financial ruin. Celino, a man Meli once knew intimately, and who is responsible for her voluntary excise from the rest of the Galdes. Knowing what she knows, infiltrating his life will be easy, but will she be able to strike when the moment arrives?This science fiction novella by Ilona Andrews - first published in 2009 - is the first book this year that I've wanted to kick myself for not reading sooner. I had the best intentions of doing so, but I used its shorter format as a justification for the delay. (""It's just a short story."") Which, no, it's actually a novella, an important difference. Not smart guys, not smart. Have I not read every Kate Daniels and Edge novel by Ilona Andrews and been entertained by their uncanny knack for incredible worldbuilding Every. Single. Time? And they did it again, and it was even a meaner feat because Silent Blade is not a full-length novel. After wasting away for months on my Kindle, I finally opened it standing in line for Bitterblue at BEA this year, and the wait time flew by.Did I mention that I couldn't put Silent Blade down? Later at the MoMA, I cut into my visit in order to finish it. Meli and Celino's turbulent past and unknown future are just that impossible to ignore. Fans of antagonism to attraction romances will feel at home here. Best of all, Meli's myriad reasons for wanting Celino to die by the fire of a thousand suns are completely warranted. There is no easy resolution for reconciliation, let alone for these two to become a couple. Nevertheless, there are some seriously hot moments for Meli and Celino, and for those who are familiar with Ilona Andrews, Silent Blade is more along the lines of The Edge novels than the Kate Daniels series romance-wise, which is at times more spelled out than I'd like. As always, the space colonized world is both effortless to grasp and rich in every detail. I loved the vivid, touchable, and atmospheric setting of New Delphi. I have not forgotten the conjured images of colorful flowers, heady scents, and earthy architecture.  I understand why the leap in time at the resolution was necessary to the plot but in a shorter format, it felt abrupt. (Perhaps I just wanted more?) I appreciated the hard-earned ending for Meli and Celino though, and look forward to reading more Kinsmen novellas. If you're an Ilona Andrews fan and you haven't read Silent Blade yet, what are you waiting for? It is a must-read.",4,1

"I really wanted to give this 4 stars for the writing style, because it was well-written, and the love(a stretch) scenes were fearless. However, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers in  that the author lost me a bit, when it came to the ""sharing"" of the heroine, Savannah. It is a testament to the Shades of Grey trilogy that I only blinked a little at the BDSM, but 5 men getting their freak on with a bound woman, was still a wicked stretch of MY imagination! Even my crazy, Christian (Shades) didn't believe in sharing! Matt-the loving sharer-really gave off mixed messages, and I found it hard to reconcile his actions with his purported emotions. I find, a day later, that I am still baffled.Nevertheless, the author still managed to tell a tale that I wanted to follow to its conclusion, despite the fine line it danced between domination and a felony!",3,1
"if I could...I just didn't feel the chemistry between the main characters and frankly the heroine really started to annoy me after the first hundred pages.

"Part allegory, part coming of age, part spiritual awakening, this book is about a teenage boy living with an alcoholic mother and a fragile younger brother. Even his mother is quick to tell him the truth that the solution Brian thinks he has found to his sad and sometimes terrifying life is the wrong one. Will his little brother pay the price for his short-sightedness, his simple plan to ""make everything better""?When his easy fixes begin to crumble to ashes Brian is forced to examine his own motives and what is really important to him. An elderly stranger and a desperate, outcast new friend push him to search for the real power to make the world a better place.What is the source of healing, of restoration, of hope? Is it in magic and ancient legends or is it closer to home, from a different source, far from ""the center of the world""? The physical quest and the spiritual one are intertwined all along the way.",4,1

"Let me start by saying that I have enjoyed several of this authors other books so I have nothing against the style in general. (Although you'd think a basic word processor would tell her about those typos)I got this book because I liked the premise and the sample.However as the book continued I began to dislike the characters. The heroine was supposedly too stubborn and wild. Well, really this means she just had her own mind. And the grandmother was just ridiculous. Why would she stop her granddaughter from doing all the things she had done? To me this was too old fashioned, gender biased and generally absurd. If the girl needed to be a virgin you can make up some other reason.The guy was controlling, but I could have looked past that. My problem was that he seemed two-faced. He would listen to stories about her day as his lover but he could be bothered to ask a follow up question as her guardian?Even if you like this type of book... I'd pass on this one.",2,0
These stories almost totally lack plot and the nature and character of the 'Thinking Machine' are not revealed.  His conclusions (like many of Sherlock Holmes) seems mysterious but alternate explanations to the data would make them look foolish.  I like the twists and mystery of these stories but find the content pretty thin.Richard Pendleton,3,1
"Given the previous reviews, I didn't expect much from this book but ended up being pleasantly surprised by the ending.  The technological aspects are glossed over, the string of events is manufactured to suit the author, and blame for the collapse of civilization is laid squarely at the feet of religon.  This isn't a serious attempt to explain and justify a point of view.  It is a pleasant diversion for and evening or two, nothing more.",4,1
"From the first page this story is gripping with a strong heroine, a psycho serial killer and a British accent.  The plot was full of twists and turns around every corner keeping the reader enthralled in the mystery and anticipation of catching the killer.  For a serial killer mystery this author is able to present a unique and entertaining take.The characters of Payce and Gavin are flawed giving them a plausible background story making them believable.  Their hardheaded dedication is a trait to be admired and it makes them inspired even more to catch the killer.I was provided a copy of the book by BTS eMag for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review - all conclusions are my own responsibility.",4,1

"As outlined in intro - don't get or read if you cannot handle graphic descriptive writing based in serial killing.  Sociopaths have no conscience, no sympathy and no empathy.  Thus, when they are describing their acts to us (or their victims) it is gonna be ugly.  And this is ugly in many of the things done.  However, I was not shocked or offended (even though I admit it was pretty gory and graphic).This book tells the tales of two people - one who picks up hitchhikers and one who hitchhikes. And a couple of people they encounter along the way to meeting up.I just was put off by the feeling of contrivance related to the ending.  While action packed to the last ""drive, "" it felt like it was just an ending to end.  Rather than a true end from having gone through paces.So so read due to unfulfilling (to this reader) end.  If any are THINKING about this short (more than half the ""book"" is intro, author interviews and excerpts from other books) I suggest downloading sample chapters (or peek in preview) to see if you would even want to insert the gory images in your mind.  Many will be upset (many will not) .I prefer the voice and excerpts from J.A. Konrath.  Your mileage may vary.Christine",4,1
I tried to read it and finish it but I just couldn't!!!  This book was awful!  The lead character was not interesting..too whiny & pathetic.  I didn't like the plot it was sooo weird!!!  I didn't read the reviews before I purchased it because I was in a hurry....Never again!!!,1,0

"What a pleasant surprise!  When I got this kindle book from Amazon, I really expected little. What I did get was a book that slowly captured my interest and pulled me into its pages. Before I got the e-book, I worried a bit about the plot line as it sounded just like another of the Dan Brown ""wanna-bes""; however, the ""Secret of the Scroll"" by Chester D. Campbell delivers on all levels and is a wonderful read and a thriller that is hard to put down.Retired Air Force OSI Agent Greg McKenzie and his wife Jill are on a trip to the Holy Land. Shortly before they return home, a souvenir street vendor convinces Jill to purchase a ""souvenir"" that turns out to be an ancient scroll. When they innocently return home, the McKenzie's world turns upside down as Jill is taken hostage in a battle between militant Palestinians and radical Israelis to recover this ancient scroll. The police, however, target Greg as a suspect in his wife's disappearance, and with a little help from his friends (and a few others), he sets out alone in a perilous chase to save his wife as she is spirited out of America and back to Israel.The ""Secret of the Scroll"" is honestly a classic page-turner; I often kept reading when I knew I should go to sleep. I just kept saying; ""Just one more chapter.""  It is a thriller without a large body count; it is a book about an historical artifact without trying to clone Dan Brown.  Yes, there is plenty of action and intrigue, but the real suspense comes from all of McKenzie's efforts to save his wife while trying to stay a step ahead of the mysterious figures who will stop at nothing to get the scroll. While there are many twists and turns in store for the reader, there is as well a strong realism in the characterization of the main character who seems to be a bit more like your neighbor rather than a James Bond super-hero type. You will like these characters and you will like the book - ""Secret of the Scroll"" (Greg McKenzie Mysteries #1).",4,1

I think most readers will agree that Zsadist is a favorite among the Brotherhood.  We love a tortured soul.  And this is Zsadist trying to interact with his precious new daughter.

"I do agree with another reviewer: if you aren't up on your Norse mythology, this book is hard to follow.  There are a lot of characters crammed into a small space, and there's way too much assumed knowledge on the part of the author.  That's the bad bit.So why four stars?  Because I found the interaction between the three main characters: Logan (Loki), Kir (Baldur), and Jordan to be just wonderful.  Bell is great at creating distinct characters that shine through their actions. Paranormal romance is often bogged down with melodramatic dialogue.  Bell's conversations are delightful--they are the kind of laughing interactions I have with my own friends (er, minus the sex).  Additionally, there was a great sweetness to the romance that was a treat to read.So here's my tip: if you want to really enjoy this book, read a quick primer on Norse mythology first.  It will be worth it.  I know I'll be reading up a little before the second installment.",4,1
"This is an interesting story, with some fun twists and unexpected turns.  It all ties up nicely at the end and left me satisfied.

There is no better she could write and write about every one in the family and when you think a young girl or man is being left to dry there she comes up with a another scenario .

"The Fall of Troy was a HOT book, but what I really enjoyed was the fact that the heroine wasn't your run of the mill twenty-four year old size six minx.  Instead she was a seasoned woman with a plus-size figure.  And she maintained that size throughout the book, which I love because all too often the heroine somehow miraculously loses weight and you're wondering why the hero is still attracted to her when her curves sold the deal in the first place.Overall the sex scenes were a little eye opening but I was fine with that and this was a good read.",4,1
"I was very disappointed in how this book started, continued and ended. I couldn't believe any part of the book and was really upset that it got worst not better. A free read, maybe. Paying for this, no.",1,0
"I didn't even finish this. My idea of a good read is not reading about someone getting gangbanged. I didn't think this book would be that way. I really thought it would have been a little more in depth, with more story and not just pure erotica. But, that's just my opinion. Check it out if you're into that kind of thing.",1,0
"I like paranormal romances. I didn't like this one and could not finish it. The heroine is an idiot. The hero ain't much better. Neither behaves with any sense, going off half-cocked when so much unnecessary drama could be avoided if they but held an honest conversation.",1,0
"Wow dragons!! Knights!! and Mistress' oh my. smiles I loved it!! A great blend of characters and story line. I just had fun reading this.

The sex was hot, the element that the pleasure of the riders and the best are intertwined. Wait did I mention the sex scenes were hot!! smiles again. A awesome tale that made you want to continue to read and a wee bit sad when you were done. Garath and Lars played the story of mellowing bel very well. Makes one think who played who. Did I mention dragon sex?? along with magic. The Mama dragon is soo endearing you cant help but love her. Its a good thing she has more books in this series. Enjoy",4,1

When he's just about to lose all hope Carey Lindenbay walks into his life and gives him a future to look forward to.  Carey gave Brock's life purpose again and Brock wants to return happiness to the life of the man who quickly became his best friend.I found Coverboy to be more of a buddy story than a romance.  Brock had a frat boy persona.  He let his fame go to his head and ended up alienating those close to him.  Carey was a lifesaver for him.  I like the camaraderie between Brock and Carey, and even though their relationship was sexually physical, I didn't view them as a couple, but more so as friends with benefits.  Dan Skinner has a fun writing style and even though Coverboy wasn't what I was expecting I will look for more of Mr. Skinner's work.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",4,1
"This is a bad, bad, awful book.  It reads as if it was written by an excited twelve-year-old.  Every other line with an exclaimation point -- I'm sorry, I didn't even know people did that for real.  It contained so many unnecessary words (things like:  ""Under the window, where he looked presently, he saw something that hadn't been there when he last looked a moment ago"") and just unfortunate phrasings.  The plot is stupid and the characters are so unrealistic it is almost impossible to believe that the author regularly consumes any type of decent fiction.  Even recreational exposure to mediocre storytelling would make this level of badness impossible.  Finally, I'm a reader who regularly reads challenging books and I'm still unclear on several aspects of the story, even after rereading them a few times.Lines like ""Suddenly, he was inside of her!"" to describe a date rape -- I'm not even making this up.  The exclaimation point is really used there.  I don't know if the author thinks this is a fresh and effective way to write or if he just doesn't care.This is a bad, bad, bad book.",1,0
"A tired formula romance with characters which are too perfect, too beautiful, too talented, too rich so as to become childishly caricatured and hardly real.

"Moxie Mezcal, &lt;strong>Sweet Dream, Silver Screen&lt;/strong> (Moxie Mezcal Publishing, 2009)Moxie Mezcal. Two drinks that, mixed, would probably combine to form the worst taste you've ever had in your mouth. Thankfully, you don't have to drink it to want to read it. Tough, literate (if amateur at times), fun slice of neo-noir reminiscent more than once of what might have happened had Kathy Acker decided to try and write Raymond Chandler.  I should probably take points off for the meta, but I'd just end up adding them back on for the wit and honesty: ""I was behind the wheel while he thumbed through the dog-eared paperback I had been lugging around in my backpack. It was a cheap murder mystery called &lt;em>Invisible Ink&lt;/em> that tried to ape the old hard-boiled detective stories of Mickey Spillane and Raymond Chandler with mixed results."" Indeed. I've read a number of complaints with the ending; I didn't see it. I'm wondering if folks didn't get it (while Mezcal drops enough hints to what's going on, she doesn't point them out--and I'm factoring in that I could be totally misreading it myself) or whether it's just too ambiguous for the average reader, but I didn't have such problems.

"I thought this book was a decent offering from Ellora's cave. Synopsis can be found in other reviews. I'm really TRYING not to use any spoilers, since this is a short read, so if you need me to clarify, please ask in the comments.I enjoyed the premise - GARGOYLES! AS SHIFTERS! The characters themselves were pretty generic - Cray was a nice guy/gargoyle. Loretta was a rich heiress just looking for love in all the wrong places.As far as the plot went... it was ok. I felt the whole ""Max"" episode could have been delved into a bit more. It was very cut and dry though ""this happened then this happened then this happened then done."" Also the staging of a dramatic scene was a little confusing as everything (I'm guessing was happening at once) could not have happened. Or perhaps just needed to be cleaned up a bit to make it make more sense [EXAMPLE (not from book)- if I'm on a roller coaster going very fast and there's missing tracks ahead, the passengers and I would not be able to hold a rational conversation in a light airy tone and buffer my nails at the same time]. The great finale I felt was super quick and ""the great revelation"" at the end completely soured the heroine for me. ""The great revelation"" seemed really pointless/unnecessary/inappropriate for the story and made me really just think the h was one dumb selfish beesh, which is sad because I had liked her well enough until that point. It was also very random and just thrown in there for a quick HEA wrap up.Refreshing premise, the romance scenes were nice, certain plot points/situations needed to be tightened a bit, definitely a quick light read.",3,1

The initial victim; a prostitute whose body is seen as little more than a piece of meat ripe for dismemberment and consumption before the predators set their sights on police officer Jack Daniels. However, you could say, they bit off more than they could chew in underestimating Daniels' survival instinct and hardened police training.

"Unlike so many other military thrillers, this one does not deal so much with individual soldiers but with the machines they fly. I thought it was a different twist and the story was non stop.

"While I was reading this, I wavered between a 3 and 4 star rating and it wasn't until I had completely finished that I felt that this was a solid 4 star read. I think this is probably marketed as dark erotica but, while it is dark with a big ole capital D, it's not very erotic. The sex, when it is described, is perfunctory, without soul and not at all sensual and certainly not erotic.There's a whole heck of a lot of non-con going on in this book so, if non-con in fiction is a hard limit for you, I probably wouldn't pick this one up. Also, my review is likely to be spoilery so if you read on, you have been warned. This is book is quite fantastical so be prepared to suspend your disbelief to enjoy the story.We start with Callie/Mischief in the hands of the police. She's been separated accidentally from her Master and is being questioned by the detectives about who she is, why she is dressed the way she is and who put the vicious red welts on her arse. She is beyond terrified, totally unable to do anything for herself and desperate to be returned to her Master.Every chapter starts this way with Callie with the detectives and then returns to the story of her initial abduction and torture. Callie is abducted from a European airport and sold by gypsies to Judgment - an institution which deals in female sex slaves. The girls are rounded up stripped of their clothes, their freedom, their choice and their dignity. They are subjected to the most appalling beatings and torture and rape in order to bring them to heel.Calllie is a particularly rebellious Slave and things do not go well for her but she catches the eye of the top Master and he decides he wants her for himself. There is a strong hierarchy among the slaves and they can rise to the position of `Personal', a coveted slave by a Master or, if they are too disobedient, sold off to the highest bidder. Callie suffers horrific beatings with her body being forced into agonising positions to maximise her pain. She constantly rebels but there is a pivotal moment in the story when you realise she has reached the point of no return. She has been completely broken but has risen to the coveted rank of Personal.Back with the detectives, it is apparent that Callie/Mischief has absolutely no capacity to function normally in the real world - she can do nothing for herself and craves only a return to her Master. What lies ahead for her in the real world is being committed, psychiatric incarceration and drug therapy. She would be essentially swapping one form of captivity for another. This is the crux of the book and the moment that the book absolutely earns its 4 star rating because I found myself wanting her to return to the brutal captivity under her Master. Despite the horror and revulsion I'd felt while reading the story of her submission, I really felt that she was better off back with him and it's this mindmelding that makes the story work for me. She may be returning to agonising beatings but at least she understands her place, understands what is expected of her and feels `at home'. She's too far gone to be able to function in the normal world and her only hope for the future is with her cruel Master who in his own way probably does love her.In this respect, this is fairly similar to Comfort Food but the similarity ends there. Comfort Food feels isolated and fairly sensual but this is a mass organisation and it didn't feel at all erotic to me.There is a sequel and I will probably read that eventually as the issues a long term sex slave faces are brushed over very rapidly despite being fairly major events and will probably get more page time in a sequel.",4,1
"I'll start with the negatives. There are chains in these stories and they bind souls/minds together. I found it hard to really get into those. I love the image of the chains sticking out, but the entire mind-control and shared sexuality just didn't do it for me.Related to that, I felt the conclusion of this story didn't really seem sense. I'm not going to spoil it. I dislike stories in general where a single event suddenly has major changes across thousand year old cultures, all because a ""human"" got involved. I don't think we're that important and it takes a while for anyone to get used to a new idea.Now, on the positives, I love the telepathy. I love the play of mental forces as two people struggled to retain control of a relationship. Trying to find an equitable balance is a hard thing for all of us and I thought it was resolved in a satisfying manner.The sex was also fantastic. Lots of details and the entire domination aspect added a hot, slick tone to the entire story. I loved that bit and I'm willing to look past the bits I didn't care for.Would I get the sequel? Probably not, mainly because of my difficulties with the premise.",3,1
It could have been better if it was longer. The story line was good but it just needed more details.,2,0
"There was a lot that I liked about this story - it starts right in the action and it provides enough detail without overwhelming.  I loved that the characters were slightly older than in books of this story - they were about ten years out of college instead of being in their teens or early twenties.  I liked that they had histories than went back more than just a few years.  The whole ""spirit animal"" thing, however, was less successful and felt a bit too simplistic.  Maybe later books do a better job of explaining it in a less hokey way, but it just didn't work for me here.",3,1
I enjoyed reading this book.  I giggled and picked it up back up whenever I had the chance.  I enjoy each of the characters and the story line. Easy read and recommend!,4,1
A very strange book to read.  The story was a good read but strange things can happen when someone comes across a skull and things start to happens.  Do we believe in ghosts?,3,1
"This was a different ""end of the world"" synopsis. No zombies, pandemic, or virus. You can guess- it is a fog. The  children grow up as young adults in this book, which I found wonderful! A refreshing read. You will see the endurance of the human spirit and can easily see what could happen in these circumstances. Not the ""fog"", but if any children were left to their own devises for a long period of time.Several people have made negative statements about a kid of 16 pairing with another, about age 27 years old. That would not be uncommon in this type of setting. The amount of people in this story are limited. Also, sexual desires often takes precedence over what would be considered normal. I never make comments of editing. I know any author is doing the best he can afford at the time.",5,1
The writing is very bad at times.  Sentences are long and confusing.  I want to love it but I can't.,3,1

"Started so well, and plummeted really quickly. I guessed the premise in the second chapter, and watched it unfold just as I thought it would.

Very poor showing.",1,0

"I was not sure what to expect. I have an ipod touch and i like to read books. When i purchased them through Iceberg Reader (I-tunes book reader software) i did not have enough variety. I was surfing through amazon and realized they offered an application for the kindle so i bought random free books to see what it was about. This was one of the books. Very different and very steamy. The story is short and i read it in like three hours. Overall it really is a good story. It does leave you kind of hanging but i ordered the second book of the series and it picks up from this book. So i really do like the book. ( i dont give any information about the book because i think you should read it for yourself, it is free after all. Although i think i would have paid for it now that i have read it.)I will say that the Sex Scenes threw me for a loop and i was NOT prepared for that. But the story outside of the sex is really good.",4,1

"It was also one of the least romantic romances I've ever read.This is not one of her better books IMO. It seemed quite stagnant to me. Although the story did manage to get from the start to the end, it was all very flat, no twists or turns, no heroes and the closest  you get to a villain is his manipulative father.He's the eldest son of an Earl. His father claims to be dying and pressures him into marrying a daughter of his best friend before he dies.She thinks she is too mousy and timid for a model of perfection such as he, to be worthy of marrying him. Of course all of society whispers their agreement with her assessment.He is still madly in love with a woman who jilted him 9 months earlier, and moans and whines about his love for her throughout 99% of the book. Lamenting her lack in comparison the perfection that was his lost love.She's as dull as a dish cloth, and only shows a drop of spark a couple of times throughout the whole book.All in all, I'm not going to complain too much, it was only 99 cents on kindle, but it really isn't one I'd bother to read again.",2,0
"I have always enjoyed every piece of work I've read by Dana Marie Bell.  This one is no difference, but I did struggle a bit which is nor normal.The characters were complex, changing names during different times, with several conflicts existing simultaneously.The world was confusing at Tim's, simply from the fact that there were apparent vast differences in time between.The characters were well developed and it's a creative story, without a doubt.  I simply struggled a bit throughout the story, having to frequently remind myself who was who and what their conflict was.Maybe it's just me...but the struggles I had with the complexity definitely removed a bit of the enjoyment for me because I had to spend so much time rehashing the past in my mind, in order to put together the current.Other than that, it was q very creative story and well structured - just complex.  I have purchased the entire True Destiny Series, as I write this there are four in total, so I will be curious to see if the coming one's are as complex.  Given the nature of the characters, my guess would be yes.  Still, Dana Marie is such an incredible Author, I would read her work if she wrote the phone book.Enjoy!Shelbie Knight =)[...]",4,1

"Previously straight identified college senior Jeremy is conflicted after drunkenly sleeping with his best friend and college roommate Ben. Adding to his discomfort is his growing disinterest in his girlfriend, and the impending changes signaled by his college graduation.Overall I have mixed feelings about this novella. While it had several hot, well written sex scenes and for the most part, able yeoman-like prose advancing the story-line, there were some transitional glitches melding the narrative story-line with the erotic scenes. Admittedly these are two very different forms of storytelling and I felt that they both warranted more development and smoother transitions than the short novella form afforded them.Another shortcoming I perceived was the ""almost adequate"" development of the main characters. We are told a few things about each of the main characters but not really enough to allow us to get fully inside their heads and fully appreciate their feelings. In part, readers read to live vicariously and when the character development is stinted, some of that fulfillment is short-changed. Again, this could have been better if the overall form had not been so rushed.Also on a mixed note, the ability of the author to create charming supporting characters is clearly shown with Al the straight but Texan roommate but the girl friend failed to ring true on almost all levels. There was no detail that allowed me to reconcile what Jeremy had originally seen in her with her nasty racist and sexist hate speech during their break-up scene. It just felt artificial, or worse, poorly written.Finally, the novella starts with a steamy recollection/fantasy but is then jolted back into a straight boy realizing he's not story. I was surprised a bit by my own reaction to having to re-imagine the boyfriend after it was reveal that he was black. While it certainly didn't affect his sexiness, it wasn't made clear in the initial description and my fantasy lover's tend to be white. For a while I found myself contemplating what my level of racism was rather than concentrating on the details of the story. However this morphed into my speculation about how much more I could have appreciated the story if I'd been given some of the build-up before the major sex scene.As with so many stories that give details like this, It's a bit tricky deciding just how much detail to reveal. It's a bit like being given a perfectly brewed cup of coffee with two sugars and milk. No matter how great the coffee and perfect the brew if one takes ones coffee unsweetened and black, it's a bit hard to appreciate the overall beverage.Overall, I've decided that I enjoyed it but will be curious to read something longer by the author to see if the imperfections I found here are cured when she has more room to work. Read it and judge for yourself.",3,1
"SPOILERS!Mostly sex scenes with a few scenes mixed in. When she was in the hospital, why she didnt have them call her husbands secretary? She seems to always be able to contact them, yet we are supposed to believe that the heroine would only try their cellphones?And why suddenly did she act like it was ALL her fault?Also, why did they act like this deal could make or ruin their career, and yet they risk their marriage by leaving her, acting like they need this for their business to survive. They didnt even get the deal! They just gave it up after two days trying, why didnt they do that before???After losing this deal their business wasnt even affected as they hired new people, and expanded their business. I know im supposed to suspend belief, but it frustrates me that they made such a big deal about nothing.",3,1

Such a shame that leaders controlling people elders etc are still wounding the body.Numbers of Christians that leave churches because they haven't.

The romance wasn't believable and the situation Genevieve was in was...well...silly.

What a pleasant surprise, to read such a well-written story.  True, there are a few spots where the editing could have been a bit better (at one point the main character is lying on his back, then all of a sudden he's on his front), but these small blemishes did not take away from the beautiful language of the piece and the clever plot (and twist at the end, which I won't spoil!).  Short but sweet, and very sexy (without being just about sex).  I'll be looking for more work by Ms. Strauss in the future.",5,1

"I really enjoyed this second installment in this series.  I just wish it had been longer.  I would also say that I liked the fact that this one, unlike the first, had chapter demarcations, even though it's short.  Chapter demarcations make it so much easier to see how close you are to the end of a chapter or to find a stopping place when you need to do so, although that's not much of a problem on short novellas.  The characters in this series so far are very realistic in my opinion.  I think this book had just the right amount of ""bits of everything"", except being so short.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you liked the first book in the series, I think you'll like this one.  Give it a shot because I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Have at it!  I can't wait to read the third and final one.",5,1

I really did not get into the story, or imagined the ""steamy"" parts of it. It has a rough start, as you really don't know what has happened or what is happening. However, I must say that Pete has some good lines in the story, such as ""I just don't plan on failure. Success is largely a matter of not giving up. And I'm sure of what I want,"" and my favorite ""nobody can be sure of the future, but I'm sure of us"". So, to sum up, not so good, but not so bad either--for a freebie.",2,0

When I read the shifters in this book were dolphins I was skeptical but my doubts were resolved immediately.  There was a romanticism surrounding the story that I absolutely adored.  There is even a bit of danger to satisfy those suspense taste buds.  Tidal Wave is a force of nature to be reckoned with.

When things seems to be to get to the end point in ruined Baltimore they will do anything to leave it behind and follow a strange call that come in their dreams....I had kept unread this ebook on my kindle for ages but haven't read it before because lately I had very bad luck with this type of short presentations to new series.....but I was in a mood for a short read so I gave it a try..so glad I did...despite the short length this story is very well written and the plot original and well developed ( AND has an ending, that is, you will not be forced to purchase the next in the series to know what was all about; though after reading this one it actually did a great job as a teaser because I will definitely continue reading the series )Only 4 stars because I wish it was longer, it has great potential for a full length novel.",4,1
"********SOME MAY CONSIDER SOME OF THIS SPOILERS*************My gosh,....HOW do I say how I felt about this without sounding like a total witch?????  Ooof.  Okay, in MY opinion the h was a complete slut. I assume there are reasons for this in her past but the author did NOT make me curious enough in the least to actually pay for the rest of this to find out why.The H is completely inconceivable as a person. He loves her after one night of sex?? Really? Actually his inner dialog says ""love"" even before the sex. She tells him straight up that she is a one night stand kind of woman, and later her friend tells him that she was involved with her sexually also. So, not only does she have sex with any man who tickles her fancy, she's not discriminate in what gender her sexcapades are with. NOT that I have anything against bi-sexual people!!!! Live and let live. But I just could not relate to these characters at all. The H hears all of this information and is still ""in love"" with her.If the author was determined to write her story this way she should've at least drawn me in enough to WANT to care why the h lets herself be passed around and rode more than a Greyhound bus.I shake my head at all the 5 stars this ""beginning"" has gotten.I love me some erotica, but there has to be feelings involved for me to enjoy it. In my opinion there were NO feelings involved in this story at all, in the least.",1,0

"After reading the description of this series, I thought these books sounded right p my alley as I love light mysteries.

I would not recommend this series.",1,0

"Man, what a load this one is. Let's see, a 35 year old virgin goes to a board meeting and for the most part is either raped by the members of the board or coerced through bondage to have sex (of some kind) with each of them.  So! What's not to like, huh?  My God, is this what women of today aspire to?  Do you actually enjoy reading about a woman trussed up like a cow at a rodeo who is then experimented on by guys with different fetishes? This woman doesn't know she is about to become the center of attention, so to speak, and is certainly not happy with her forced entry into BDSM, yet our wonderful story teller continues with her tale.Matt, the CEO, has rigged up a machine which suspends a woman while fully restraining her at the same time.  With this fantastic device, which just happens to be installed in the board room, he can show our female protagonist just how much he and his fellow board members ""love"" her.I am appalled that the author would have you believe the average woman on the streets would enjoy this type of depravity and would, in fact, state her undying love for her antagonist.  The book has errors and omissions, but the real problem with this type of nonsense is that it gives the impression that if you are a large, dominant, sexually attractive male you can do what you want with a woman and, no matter how weird it is, they will love you for it.  GIVE ME STRENGTH!!!  Look, what you do in the bedroom with your spouse or lover is your business, and if you want to beat each other senseless while having consensual sex, Okay.  Just remember, coerced sex isn't consensual sex; it's rape.  Just because this book is fiction doesn't excuse its implications.  Honey!  Where's my two-by-four??? I want to show you how much I ""love"" you.  Barrrrrffffff.",2,0

"I just finished this book -- I read it all in one day because I could not put it down. What an amazing first book for this new author!! Bravo Eric!!The story is fast-paced, never stopping. The main character, Argus, is immediately likeable which I found strange because he is a troubled paranoid schizophrenic. Throughout the story you are kept guessing because you are not sure what is real and what has been imagined from that tormented mind -- it gives you a glimpse into the mind of someone who suffers from this.The plot moves fast, right from the beginning, and the story keeps you guessing ""who dunnit"" until the end.For this price, you are getting MORE than you deserve in terms of entertainment value.I am keeping Eric Christopherson on my radar for future novels.",5,1

"The elf child does something wrong and instead of owning up to it, runs away, and hides in what turns out to be Santa's sack. The elf 'redeems' himself by saving Santa from a snowman with a karate kick to the snow man.  The disobeying and then running away plot is overused in a lot of self-published children's books.  The whole first part of the story about the toys being manufactured factory-style instead of hand-made by elves was dull to my grandkids.  Hard to get  them to make it to the end of the story.  I thought the karate kick to the snow man was ridiculous but it was funny to them and actually the only part of the book they responded to.",2,0

"I was a really hesitant to read this book. I loved the fact that Scott & Alyssa got together in the 1st book and when I read about a couple finding each other I like to think when I finish that book that they stay together and think to myself "" wow,wasn't that so romantic"" Corny I know but hey, that's why we read this romances. To hear that a couple fall deeply in love with their soul mates. So I gave this book a try, only to realise that Alyssa is no longer with Scott. Major heart break on my side! The rest of this story I could have really done without. But when I start a book even though it is bad or not what I want, I will finish it. Do I think that Alyssa and Alex should be together? Maybe, but deep down I still believe that Devina should have left the 1st story end the way it did and not create another franchise out of it.",3,1

"Have been a fan of Andre Norton for many years and this is an excellent collection of her books, a few I have already read, but many are new to me.

"It took all  of the will power I had to finish this book. I love time travel stories,the quest,the history.I've read 100s of this genre and this is by far the worst one of them all. Three Americans walk threw a doorway to the beginnings of Egypt.Tim Hope, who is in a deep depression,goes on a trip that he and his wife planed,Brian and his girlfriend Dianna,take the same trip out of boredom.Tim the geek,Brian the jock,Dianna the cheerleader.I had no use for Tim after he took Meryt, a young teenager for a lover.Mr.Dubs tries to couch this as acceptable because of the times.Which is correct.But what decent man with the values that Tim Hope, is portrayed to have, raised in this time, could ever find it acceptable to bed a 13 or 14 year old child.Brian is the only one of the three that I found interesting.Dianna was a selfish, uninteresting version of the american female that makes me sick to read about.A lot of history that was enjoyable,some of it was well wrote.But I could not for the life of me find anything that would make me want to lend this book to anyone.",2,0
I like Jayne Rylon's writing but this left me cold.  I have to agree with the writer who gave the book two stars.  I just couldn't get into the book and it was just boring.  I couldn't finish it and I am putting it down hoping to finish it.  The sex scenes were even boring because it was more about the experiment than the two people involved.  Jayne does a lot better than this and a lot of reviews were good but this just may not have been the book for me.  It happens sometimes but do not let this review deter you from buying her work.  She has great books.,1,0
"I really enjoyed the first three stories in this series.  I find the whole menage thing wierd, but I liked the idea of the story.  I liked the relationship between Jane, Santos and Antonio, and the beginning was good.  *spoiler* I was turned off when they ""shared"" her with their friends at this club.  I was further turned off when she has sex in her office with Archer.  I love stories where the characters love each other, but I am not sure I see the romance in everybody having sex with everybody else.  By the end of the story, I didn't see the ""love"" that was supposed to be shared.  Just my opinion: I prefer the main characters to stay true to one another (even within a menage)!",2,0
"There's just way too much action, far too many lying cheating men, and loads of money spent flying to England.  The main character who is supposed to have some smarts falls for one jerk after another.  She works for a threatening idiot, and never gets around to contacting the FBI until late in the narrative - even though she knows they are interested in the boss and getting him locked up would end her troubles.  But that would mean a few 100 pages less of nonsense.  I'm all for people living their dreams of being novelists, but this isn't a good book.",1,0

"The brothers are arrogant and condescending. They're always laughing at Elizabeth and bullying her. And Elizabeth, to say the least, is ridiculous, stuck in a never ending loop of whining that they need to see that she's grown up then throwing a childish temper tantrum and cursing at them. She does this over and over again. She's pathetic. And the brothers are constantly groping her breasts, rubbing up against her, and making out with her while her young daughter is right there-sometimes even in her arms-and she just lets them.I couldn't stand her, the book is not well written, and my money has been thoroughly wasted.",1,0
"This little book was fun - I almost fell off the couch laughing more than once. Intriguing characters, interesting plot, descriptively written. I loved Debra; the author did a great job of building her personality, and because of that I was surprised when Debra jumped into bed with Maddox when she did. Because of how Debra handled her attraction to Maddox before this, I didn't think she was yet at the stage where she'd give in to her, and his, lust. I would also have liked to see more story before the sex scene, which was long and fairly explicit. The book began at a good pace, but after the above-mentioned scene, it was very rushed, flying along as if out of control. Carsen could have written a longer book instead of filling the latter part with excerpts of her other books. But, having said that, she did well with her story within the restrictions imposed by a novella-length book.Quibbles aside, if you want a short, excellently written, entertaining read with humor, romance and some excitement, you'll like Carolina Wolf. Sela Carsen is a very talented writer and I'll definitely be reading her other books.",4,1
"Why a whole book for only one chapter?It's comic book style story, and the first chapter only barely scratched the surface of the story.

"From the cover I thought I would really like this book. The only thing I liked about it was the cover. There is no mystery or suspense in the book at all. It is very predictable. You know who the killer is almost from the very beginning. Even though the author attempts to throw off who the real killer is, it is a poor and lame attempt. The main character Tyler seems to gain super human strength and intelligence at times. If it wasn't for his ""intuition"" and sudden knowledge of things he had no previous knowledge of a few chapters previously, then there would be no way for him to ""solve"" the murders. The portrayal of the police is laughable at times. They're idiotic morons when the author needs them to be and super sleuths when he needs the story to move forward. All of the characters need more development and are poorly written. I'm not sure what all the 5 star reviews were for. I'm glad I got this as a free download I would not have been pleased if I had paid for this.I normally try to find something I like in a book, but in this one I can't say there is anything.",1,0

"I picked this book up for free quite some time ago, and finally had the time and the urge to read it. It's professional in presentation, and I found few errors, so I was impressed with that. I'm not thrilled with the cover art, but that is more a matter of taste than any failing on quality. This book would look good next to a big six book on the shelf. It's worth paying for, and I'm shocked to see that it is still available for free. So is the sequel. Wow.First of all, be prepared for a long read. Granted this isn't a 1,000 page monstrosity like some fantasy books that come out, but it is well over 600 pages, so it's a healthy read. Personally, I would have broken it into two books. At 52% a major plot line resolves, and while the overall &#34;evil&#34; is still around, the book could have easily finished up at this point, and the rest of the overarching plot could have been resolved in a second book.There's quite a lot of decent action, and the bad guys are suitably bad. I think the good guys could have been a bit more competent, or at least have more than one or two people who could actually do anything. I realize we want the heroes to appear properly heroic, but I felt at time that the population was so lacking that they almost deserved to get slaughtered. The trials that the main hero and heroine undergo are impressively trying though, so that was nice.I'd actually call this a 3.5 star rating. It's good enough that I will be reading the sequel, but as it is also over 600 pages, it will have to wait until I'm up for something that long.",3,1
I don't like to leave less than positive feedback but this book was a miss. The author did try to give good character development but went too far. I didn't need to have a play by play of the main character Sam's lunch every day. And it got so muddied as to what we as the readers were to focus on!  What's with the magic box? How does her pastry business have anything to do with the story? Too many ideas and a lack of focus. Sorry :(,2,0

"I finished The Stranger almost 3 months ago but couldn't put my thoughts on it into words for a review.After reading the first few chapter I was unsure on whether I'd read or not. I didn't like the idea of the hero deceiving the heroine but he grew on me and so did this story.5 years ago, Caleb and his half brothers pass the Shafton farm house and ask for a meal. Laura Shafton's naive husband welcomes the strangers with open arms and soon the unthinkable happens when one the brothers attempts to rape the pregnant Laura her. Caleb tries to stop his brother but Laura's trauma over the attempted attack and the murder of her husband has her implementing all of the brothers in the crimes including Caleb. The 3 brothers leave and Laura is left scarred, traumatized and a widow with a baby on the way.Fast forward 5 years later. After being released from prison (being the caught scapegoat while his brothers get away), Caleb still remembers the pretty Laura Shafton and what happened at that ranch. He passes by wondering if she's okay and what happened to her. When he gets there he finds Laura and her 4 year old son and seeing her scarred face and haunted eyes brings back the memories. To absolve himself for even being there, he offers to help her around her ranch. She cautiously takes the stranger's offer and soon finds herself befriending the mysterious and rugged Caleb while her son falls in love with having a male figure around.I was really surprised to find myself actually liking this story. Laura is such a strong heroine. You'll cry for all she's lost in family, raising her son alone and losing her confidence in showing her face in town embarrassed by her scarred face. How she survived her ordeal and kept on moving makes her a heroine to love. Caleb is a hero you sympathize with. As a half breed (American/Native American), you feel for him wanting to be around his brothers and accepted but realizing how evil they are and trying to fully break free from their holds even when they're not around.I enjoyed Caleb and Laura separated and definitely together and her son is adorable and his relationship with Caleb and Caleb's ""fatherly"" patience with him made me like Caleb even more.Overall: I'd definitely pick this one up if I were you. Take it from one picky reader when I say that.",4,1

"This is not a book to be set aside lightly. This is a book to be put down and avoided entirely.What I've found aggravating about self published books lately is how, inevitably, they are edited by the author's friends or family members. While I'm sure they're all very nice people, they are not experienced in helping a story achieve cohesion. They also don't want to hurt your feelings.This book suffers from a lack of good, critical feedback. We are hardly introduced to the heroine before she's immediately whisked off into a highly unlikely series of events that she doesn't understand, so how could the reader?Without knowing more about the heroine, why would I care what happens to her?All the supernaturals are the same as they ever were - cold vampires, hot werewolves, ineffectual witches. The author describes four unrelated characters as having flame red hair and emerald eyes. That's a lot of freaking redheads with. Cliched green eyes, which are just not that common.There's an issue with the heroine initially being attracted to virtually every man she meets, so her insta-love with yet another man had little impact.Style wise, the plethora of choppy short sentences beginning with &#34;I&#34; just grated. I did this, I did that. &#34;I walked to the door. He stood at the door. I went through the door. He followed me.&#34; Then a giant info-dump. Rinse and repeat. Just jerky and inept - I found myself editing silently for flow and consistency.Some embarrassing mistakes - &#34;ying to her yang&#34; - and equally embarrassing attempts at sarcastic humor, none of which were successful. Instead, heroine did a whole lot of adolescent and pointless whining about herself even when a huge apocalyptic Bad Thing was taking place.This book strikes me as one that would probably get an A as a high school project and impress friends and loved ones, but just isn't at a professional level yet. Couldn't get past the limitations of plot or amateurish writing style enough to finish it, so I returned it for a refund.",1,0

"Cade has 16 facial piercings (Elliott counted) and is on recycling duty as part of community service for trashing his ex's car. Elliott is there for possessing stolen property (bought a stolen purse). They both grab an envelope with tickets for a concert and agree to meet after to decide who gets them. Elliott is the opposite of rude, pierced, tattooed Cade. He's 10 year's younger, a travel agent, ""nice boy"". Yet he's fascinated by Cade and when a few nights later Cade invites him to a concert he goes against his better judgment. Cade's piece of crap car breaks down after some weird concert and they are stuck in the mountains in the winter. They end up getting down in the back seat and after finally getting home kind of settle into seeing each other. Cade is Elliott's first (beyond BJ's) and things are going well until Cade runs into his ex at the concert they found the tickets for and he freaks and tries to give Elliott the brush off. Something I thought was interesting which is not usually touched on was that Cade's ex had been having unsafe sex and he'd been tested but had to wait until his 6 month test came back clean. I always understood that you needed that 6 month window but I know in most books once they get that first test that they are clean everything is bareback city. Anyway, I love me some tattooed pierced bad boys and the opposites attract thing. There's really not much to the plot, just the guys trying to form a relationships, Cade's insecurity at Elliott's youth and what that will mean. But when I want a comfort read it's a go-to for me.",5,1
I was looking forward to reading this book but I almost put it away couple of times in the first half of it. I never really grew to like the main character. Her urge to prove herself just fell flat. It seemed to me that she created all her so called problems just being bored and I was bored as a reader most of the time as well. There was a chuckle time to time but no LOL moments for me. I do not recomend.,2,0
I downloaded FORTY YEARS LATER after finishing GRAND VIEW by the same author.  I enjoy the character of David Grossman and I really like Steven Jay Griffel's writing.  The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars was a couple of plot points that weren't resolved.  I contacted the author via Facebook and came away with a different perspective after the exchange.  I'm about to download the third book in the series.,4,1
"Apparently the character and storyline is a reprisal of a couple of earlier books.  Although there are some vaguely interesting ideas here, most of this short story consists of bureaucratic office humor (which only Dilbert gets right).  It was a nice try, but thankfully free, and I don't think I'll bother with the books.",2,0
"I liked this book more than I thought I would. While I wish it was a little longer, I still liked the characters and felt invested in their happiness. This is the first book of the series I have read, and based on this one I will buy the others in the series.",4,1
This could have been so much more good story line way to short. Characters  just didn't have enough time quick read thanks for low price,3,1
The erotic sex scene was the only part of the story that captures a readers interest in completing this book. I expected more from this author.,3,1
"I found it interesting that there is no continuous protagonist to this book.  Yes there are a few critical characters established in the early chapters but once their contribution is complete the book does a good job of shifting gears from fun engineering nerdiness to a pretty serious military Sci-Fi.  In fairness, the early characters never leave the story as they show up to give philosophical observations and to give some technological nudges to the plot.I do highly recommend it though and I'm very curious to read the next in the series.  If I had one niggling criticism it would be all the similarities between the alien species to ourselves.  It's a little too star trek-ish for my personal tastes but most folks will probably be cool with it.  A good solid 4 to 4-1/2 star read.",4,1
"The story begins with an accident and a man working to save some people. He loses two but manages to help a boy and the woman he had promised to protect. We head to the hospital and find out that Dr. Wes Atherton and Katherine were on a date despite her being affianced to a man awaiting her in the states. Wes calls her mother and despite that he has fallen for Katherine he even calls her fianc&eacute; who is apparently cheating on her. After some time and some news, Katherine ends things with her fianc&eacute; and stays with Wes in his home in London while she continues to recover. Things progress to where she and Wes fall in love, but it seems the fates want to keep them separated or kill one of them.The story follows through a few near death experiences while Wes comes to terms in believing two siblings (Jennifer and Will) about some paranormal reaper. He has to allow his mind to accept that although he is a psychiatrist by trade, not all things are as finite as he thought. The story is well written and keeps you hooked. Between your happiness in some cases, fear in other, sadness for loss in a few, and joy for the ending; you can't help but read it through to the end. Definitely give it a go.",4,1
"The details of Lincoln's death watch have been well publicised . The words of the  attending physician seemed to solicit assurance that he did all that could be done to extend the President' s life .

"This is book one of the Pleasure Inn Trilogy.  The Trilogy is about 3 best friends who have worn off men.  The 3 women are not only best friends but also business partners; they own an interior design firm.  Each woman has had her fill of men; Lindsay Bells is tried of the deadbeat men she dates scrounging off of her; Anna Deveau is looking for Prince Charming, but only finding self-serving aholes; Candace Steele is tired of men who used her for daddy's connections and influence.

A very poorly written book! I felt it was just written to capitalize on Christmas and the story line was very weak.,1,0
The cover fit perfect but I did not know at the time once is was on there were no instructions to remove it. When I had to replace my Kindle Dx I did not remove I just shipped it back along with my Kindle . I did not want to damage the unit. I feel getting the replacement  Kindle Dx more than compensated for the small I\price for the cover. I would advise Amazon to include removal instruction so when you want to change covers it can be done . As always happy to do business with Amazon. AABoulet,3,1
Three out of three. This is a good series.I enjoyed it very much and hope there are many more.Thank you.,4,1
i dont like it.its a waste of my time and money. i should of gotten something else. dont buy this it's terrible.boooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,3,1
I love the entire series. I love this new take on shape shifters of modern day. I could not get enough of the series and I await the next installment. Please keep it coming and for you I might even read the next Homoerotic jump off you have coming out.,5,1
"Loved it!!! They both saved each other and were good for each other, great love and sensual story. I don't like some of this author's novels but this one i absolutely did get into it first for the unusual male character (being disfigured post accident) but you quickly forget about his scars and root for him to be seen again and loved for the real handsome and generous man he is inside out not the facade of heartless business jerk he likes to portrait as a defense mechanism.",4,1

"I feel as if I am reviewing two separate and distinct books that just happened to have many of the same characters.  The first book seemed to be about a guy with no particular job or goal in life except when he needed to replenish his bank account enough to stock the fridge with more steaks and beers.  At one point he finds a teenage girl on the beach who is exceedingly drunk.  So drunk that he takes her to his home and puts her to bed twice changing her clothes and she being naked.  Then we zoom back to the present day where  he knocks up his girlfriend and the rest of the first book is all about arguing both sides of the abortion/pro-life/pro-choice issue. As we read about the issue(s) involved this guy gets shot at and delivered a package of blood and tissue representative of an aborted fetus.  At no time does he ever call the police.  He calls his drinking buddy.  The drunk teenage girl disappears and her mother comes to this guy requesting that he find her.  He has pissed off the pregnant girlfriend who tosses him out on his ear, and the missing teen is killed in a traffic accident,  so he decides to go undercover as a humble hayseed who travels to where the girl was killed to get the real story. Things that make you go hmmmmmmm.Now we are at book two where humble hayseed gets himself hired as a handyman at a convent where something shady is going on.  The convent just happens to take care of pregnant teens and a mysterious black limo appears at night and pregnant teens give birth but their babies seem to disappear.  I'm sure you can figure out the rest.The book(s) isn't awful, but the author appears to have written two different books -- one that needed a beginning and one that needed an ending so he stuck them together and voila.And although I have no problem with stretching the believability scale when reading fiction, I gotta tell ya I don't believe a man is going to pick a drunk out of her gourd teenage girl and have her naked twice in his bed but nothing happens.  No man is that low on testosterone or that saintly.  What guy would be stupid enough to set himself up for a rape accusation.  Then he gets shot at and does nothing but spackle the holes in the wall?If you have time to kill and $2.99 you can't decide how else to spend go for it. After all, you won't always get two books for the price of one.",3,1
"This is a quick read so I didn't get as much time to enjoy the characters as I would like and it felt a bit rushed, but overall very enjoyable",4,1
"I thoroughly enjoyed this ebook. In the vein of Hitchhiker's guide, it doesn't take itself too seriously. I recommend it if you want to be entertained by a fast-paced sci fi tech novel with engaging characters. I will definitely buy other books by Daniels.",5,1

Long winded but  a good  book,3,1
I like reading science fiction and I did want to try reading science fiction erotica so this was my first attempt at reading anything like this.  I was not overly impressed or cared that much for this book.  The story and sample sounded interesting of a women geneticist Andrea and a doctor Roark being taken by somone named Mal Ton attempting to save his world I think that is what the story was supposed to be about and something I might like. Throughout the whole book it seemed that the story was just sex and there really wasn't a story involved.  I attempted to try to understand the story after rereading it but it was just a porno with no plot.  I think it would have been easier to just watch it on cinemax then read about it.,2,0
Interesting story about the inflated values society follows.  Great whodunit!  It keeps you guessing about what is really going on.  No redeeming morality in sight.  A sad commentary on values.,4,1
"If you love a great Vampire book with romance and love then you need to check out this book. It was absolutely wonderful and the characters will steal your heart :)Brace yourself when you start to read this book. The beginning will have you an emotional wreck.  It sure did me. I was so angry and sad all at the same time. I felt absolutely horrible for Robyn and all that she went through. She endured a lot of abuse and it really got to me.Robyn was a very strong young lady. She went through things that most people wouldn't survive yet she kept going and doing the best that she could.  When she meets Trigg, I immediately adored him. He is so very charming and mysterious. But then you learn that he's so much more. He is very caring and has a really big heart especially when it comes to Robyn. I loved how as soon as he laid eyes on her he was protective of her and wanted to do nothing but help her and show her that not everyone was going to hurt her. Everything about him will make you love him.""Before you came into my life. I wanted nothing and no one. I lived day in and day out caring only about my mission to seek out and destroy Rogues. You have shown me something I have never felt before-love. I almost lost you and I couldn't bare it. Will you have me as your mate?""Then she meets Trigg's friends, Vane and Rayne. They both welcome her just as Trigg did and accept her in their lives. They all help her to grow and show her the good that is in the world. They all help her to open up her mind and she finally feels safe and at home with them.I really enjoyed seeing their love for one another grow and that no matter what they learned about each other they still wanted to be with one another. Even when she discovers who Trigg really is, she isn't afraid of him and trusts him.  I loved and mean loved getting to know about the watchers and vampires in this book. The guys are all three amazing and I instinctively loved all of them.  I loved all of the characters in this book with the exception of those who hurt Robyn and her mother.I was so glad when Robyn met Rosa, Darla, Phillip, & Abigail. They all pretty much became like family to her, she finally had friends and that made me so very happy. Rosa was great to Robyn from the start and helped her out which made me love her that much more.Now brace yourself for the end of the book as well. I couldn't help it, I cried because of what happened. Robyn truly had one of the biggest hearts and very courageous which she shows near the end when she saves Darla & Abigail. I was so happy that Robyn gets to see her mother again. Even though she's faced with a decision that could forever change her life. I don't want to give too much away, but I was so rooting for a happy ending at this point and hoping that Trigg and Robyn would get the ending they so much deserved. Thankfully the more I read the happier I got. I was beyond ecstatic for the two of them.I can't wait to get to read the next book in this series so I can see where things go for Vane and Rosa because I loved both of them in this one.",5,1
"Ahh Maggie Shayne.  All those years ago, back when the imprint was Silhouette Shadows, Eric Marquand stole my heart.  The first book I ever read to make a vampire the romantic lead, you kicked off a genre that has exploded and will not be stopped.  Truly groundbreaking, I thank you so much for leading the way and clearing a path for more.If you haven't read these books, DO SO NOW!A human can only become a vampire if they contain a rare blood antigen, and each vampire has one human with the antigen (a chosen) whom they feel drawn to protect.  A government agency, DPI (department of paranormal investigations), is out to capture and make lab rats out of every vampire possible and they're not above using The Chosen to do it.  And if they can't capture, they don't hesitate to kill.With this series, you get a complete story of two characters in each book, but we still get to reacquaint ourselves with some of our favorites along the way.Having read these books as a teenager, I was hesitant to reread them as an adult.  So many books that I loved back then fail to resonate with me now.  Wings in the night did not disappoint and I was enthralled once again.I truly believe that without this series, we would have no Twilight, no Midnight Breed, and no Blackdagger Brotherhood.  I'm not saying Wings In The Night inspired those books, I'm saying Wings In The Night created the genre and made it popular.",5,1

"I have to say this is not one of Shannon Stacey's best works, but it was fun and very, very steamy. It would have been so much better, if the story was a bit longer, there was more depth to the main characters, and the story line a little bit more in detail, as far as the main characters backgrounds are concerned.Would I recommend this book? Probably. It was still very funny, steaming HOT, and a very quick read.",3,1
"The more I read this book the more familiar it sounded, I was ready to turn the author in for copyright infringement and then I looked it up; it was the same author from a previous book I read ""The Hunger"".  It is basically the same book.  It did keep me reading and I finished it, I was a little disappointed in the end but it was worth reading.Cons: 1. The rape scenes were disturbing because there were so many of them and graphic.  2. She gave away the plot at the beginning of the book and it was not a surprise when it was revealed. I don't know if this was purposeful or overlooked by accident but anyway I would have enjoyed it more not knowing who the ""bad guy"" was from the beginning. 3. Why do the heroines always have to be ""innocent""? (just a pet peeve)Pros: Good character development. Good twists.",3,1

"FYI: This is a short novella - not a full length story.This is the Second installment in the Take Me, Lover Series by Charlene Teglia.  You don't have to read them in order but I suggest you do.This was offered as a free kindle book, and I have to say the price was about the worth.  I have to say that even for a novella this story was way underdeveloped.  This installment is the story of Anna Parker (Maggie's sister) and Pete Crenshaw (Adam's business partner).  Anna is a recently divorc&eacute;e and mother of a 5-month old baby boy.  Her ex-husband, Brad, is well...a plot filling character.  There is not much to this novella - it took about 20 mins to read and forget.  Not the usual quality I expect from this author.The other installments in the series:The first installment,Redline Lover: Take Me, Lover, Book 1was better than this one - there was more development (both character and plot).It reunited Maggie Parker (Anne's sister) with former race driver Adam Richards (Pete's business partner).  Maggie is a journalist who wants to tell Adam's story, but he has secrets to protect.The third installment,Adventure Lover:Take Me, Lover, Book 3, seems unrelated to the prior installments.  It takes place in the Olympic High Divide between travel agent Jill Martin and wilderness guide Ryan Lowe.The fourth installment,Dangerous Lover: Take Me, Lover, Book 4is the story of  accounting student/waitress Cherry Harris and firefighter Joe Deluca.",2,0

"If you are looking for a serious story, steer clear. This one is pretty ridiculous and silly. Yet, I found myself laughing at some of the situations these folks got into and the witty dialogue. I liked it for the simple read that it is. The writing is good I think it was the author's intent for this to be campy.Rebecca's transitions were plain ridiculous. After spending a lifetime under her father's thumb, she wants to be bold and colorful. Yet she could never think of repurposing her Madam aunt's whorish dresses into something a little more demure to find a happy medium between her and her man. The 'chickens' figured that out for her. I enjoyed that she snapped back at Lucy of the Bible Brigade.Sexy Sheriff Adam is fairly one dimensional (would have like to get some history about him) and their romance was really non-existant. They were hot for each though. Particularly after she offers her virginity to him. Well, it's either that or auction it to the highest bidder now that she's the owner of the whorehouse. To keep law and order he's always threatening to shoot someone. And actually does it a few times.The villain was just tossed in, I'm convinced, to be the Snidely Whiplash of the story. That's exactly what I thought of when he enters town.",4,1

"so don't plan to become a permanent subscriber when 14-day trial period expires.  It's a decent means to notify subscribers of various freebies, Kindle Daily Deal and other tidbits, and I commend the author for his entrepreneurship.  However, the blog isn't for me and I'd rather put the 99 towards buying a book each month.TWO KEY REASONS: (1) Only a few books have interested me so far; I can easily check Amazon's top 100 freebies at my leisure and find better pickings. (2) There's no way to immediately purchase a book, or to even ""bookmark""/flag one on a page as a reminder. (Yes, perhaps I'm a tech dunce expecting too much but a link to a teeny-tiny static Amazon product page does nothing for me. I've already read about the book in the blog so a direct purchase link would be better.)OF LESSER IMPORTANCE: (1) Date/time stamp (if any) appears at the end of an article and not, say, with the header (also not helpful is the vague ""as of this posting""), so I frequently continue onto the next article only to realize a click or two later that I've already looked at it. (2) I already check Kindle Daily Deal via 2 clicks on my Kindle.  (3) Providing various other links is meaningless if one can't read or navigate once a page loads.

"Cute story if you're willing to completely suspend your logic and common sense for a few hours.Discouraged by his medical practice after realizing that all his efforts can not save the world, Ben Torres, a trauma surgeon, punches a patient and is suspended from ER.His friends and his boss, charge Jessica Bradford, the ER main nurse, to babysit Ben, stop him from drinking and get him back to work as soon as possible.Jessica, an ex wild girl, tries her best to put Ben back on track.I can't believe that anyone with a six-month experience in the medical field would act as this surgeon. Bad things happen all the time and the ER departments are the first in line to see the effects of human stupidity. Ditto for Jessica, who takes the whole of the book to see Ben as a normal person, with flaws and qualities and not a superhero.For Ben to just want to have fun (i.e drinking, having sex and hold a job with little responsibilities) is childish. For Jessica to dress up with cowboy boots, short skirts and clinging tops to get his attention is demeaning. For them both to (almost) have sex in public places, well, at this point, their actions make so little sense it works with the rest of the plot.This story would have worked better if the characters were teenagers and not the mature adults they are supposed to be.",2,0

There, she begins investigating whether a death of one of the locals is murder or suicide.

I think if the book had been longer the author could have developed the story a bit more.She did a great job of describing the setting - both the Blue Ridge and the town - and it just made me want to read more.

Miranda's husband of 18 years, Alexi, a lighthouse keeper, has been gone for four months on a secret mission for the governor. He has not written to her in two months. Finally, she leaves her two teenage sons to man the lighthouse and sets off for the town where her husband's letters were sent from. An orange cat who has recently added himself to her family comes with her. Perplexingly, she is accused of practicing magic because the cat has extra toes. The Prefect for her town arrives and bails her out and encourages her to continue her search for her husband. Someone is following her, the police are not cooperating and she must find clues to his whereabouts on her own. Despite rumors of magic, which she believes does not exist and is a bunch of nonsense, and mysteries and lies, she continues her search to find her husband.This is a great book and I really enjoyed it!",4,1

I didn't even find the sex scenes compelling, since neither the characters nor their interest in each other were skillfully developed.  I posit too that people in imminent danger of being murdered are not likely to take time out for some nookie while they are still in an extremely vulnerable locale.  Nor are they likely to take even more time to make a phone call from that locale - a call that could easily and safely be completed via cell phone as they sped away to a safehouse.Wish I could figure out which kind of tales these are before buying - its not always obvious.",2,0

A couple of days after this, once I got back on schedule,I started the second book at about noon, right after lunch. So I didn't have to stay up all night.The development of the players in this story are out standing. We even get into the mind of the zombie's! Which was a new slant.Mr. Clodi is a very good writer. I will probably check out his other books. So far I'm a fan of his.If you lik zombie stories, this is a must read.",5,1

"A real winner by Dana Marie Bell. A Sidhe lord with a twist of leprechaun and you get Leo, a sidhe lord you will love and his quirky little mate Ruby, will give you a read you won't soon forget. Well worth the price. Looking forward to book two in this series.",5,1
"Professor Hardwigg finds a note written by Arne Saknussem inside of a scientific text  that says he journeyed to the center of the Earth.  Determined to do the same and become famous for it, Hardwigg and his nephew pack up and go to Iceland to follow in Saknussem's footsteps.Although the science is rather dated, the book is still a good read and held my attention throughout.  It was interesting to see how far science has come and to realize that some of the things we think of as truths now may be proven wrong in the future.  This was a good old adventure story and I would recommend it.",4,1

"A lust filled love story wherein one falls in love with the one who kidnaps her.Storyline: Diona and Darlyle Brown are two orphan sisters who lead a modest life in Britain. Darlyle one day suddenly informs her elder sister Diona, that she is going to marry Alexis, the brother of a rich business tycoon Nikias Dranias, and elopes to Greece. Diona sensing trouble immediately shoots off to Greece to save her sister from a disaster. But she gets kidnapped by Nikias and held hostage in his private island, having been mistaken as Darlyle. Her stay in the luxurious island and repeated vigorous sexual encounters with the rich, handsome and sexy Nikias brings her intimacy and ultimately she falls in love with him. Nikias, though initially mistakes her to be a schemer and master sketcher to claim some ransom from him on behalf of her sister, later realizes that Diona came to Greece just to take her sister away from his brother Alexis, and he wrongly kidnapped her instead. Meanwhile Alexis and Darlyle get married and live happily. The true love of Diona is reciprocated by Nikias by not only confessing his love to her but also with an offer to marry her; just at the time when Diona decides to leave Nikias forever, instead of just being his bed partner.Positives: A beautiful soft story to reveal how love between two strangers can be born so suddenly, out of nowhere. Also to elicit that sometimes lust and physical attachment gives way to long lasting love and undoubtedly becomes the binding factor for two people to stay together forever. Very plain and smooth ride through the book. Good enough for a weekend time pass. Love rides though wealth gallops.Negatives: Except for the mistaken kidnap and violent sexual encounters between Nikias and Diona, there are not much twists and turns in the story. Very few rich guys out there nowadays who do not mix love and lust together. Does physical intimacy between a male and female enhance true love? Or does it bring it down?My rating is 3 out of 5",3,1

"If you like the Movie Expendables 3, here is a book for you.  It reminds me of the genre of the dime novel that spoke of the gunfighters, Indians, Bill Cody in the wild west;however, the storyline of this book was transported to the 2013.  I do like Buck Rogers stories.  This is the same level of read. If you like books with symbolism, meaning, great 3-dimensional characters, themes, this book is more of the all-too-common, self-publishing storyline without character and dialog development: A 4 to 5 star book makes character so real that you feel you know personally.I kept thinking, hoping it would get more more believable as it continued, and it got more unbelievable as it went forward.",2,0
"I just finished this book and I have no idea why I kept with it.  Maybe I hoped it would improve...it didn't.  The ""plot"" is exposed early in the book and from there it just sort of repeats itself to finallllllly arrive at the conclusion which is no huge surprise once you get there.  I couldn't come up with a likeable character to cheer for in the entire book.  I think Uncle Sy was the fortunate one.  He died before the book started and missed the whole miserable episode.  I'm so glad it was free cause it was definitely well priced.",1,0
"A well written and very highly developed Paranormal world of werewolves, Cry Sanctuary  sucks you in immediately as the action begins from the onset and keeps going to the end. The book follows the story of Abigail, whom is rescued by a friend from a sadistic Alpha and brought to Red Rock, Montana. There Abigail meets Keith who is a bit troubled by his past, but can't deny the urge to ""protect"" Abigail. The crazy, sadistic Alpha that made Abigail won't let go, though and when he kidnaps Abagail's sister to lure her from Red Rock --- Keith and Abigail must break every rule to save her.This was a great Kindle Free Find and I enjoyed the read, the action, the sexy goodness and the author's writing. I hadn't read Moira Rogers before so this was a wonderful introduction. I can't wait to read more of her writing.RECOMMENDATIONS: Paranormal Romance fans should enjoy. There are some intense sexual encounters, so mature readers only.",4,1

"Danny was a hoot!  Took a chance and ordered this and I stayed up and read this completely.  Found myself laughing out loud because Laney was feisty and had a conscience.

Would like to know why she wasn't sure about her family meeting him.  I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from this particular author.",5,1
"This is a short story first published in 1940 as a two part serial in the pulp fiction magazine Argosy. The author later decided to develop the characters in three novellas which have also been adapted to the Kindle. This is a very quick read, and thus since it is so inexpensive I recommend that anyone who is interested in the genre and plans to read the subsequently published books( which I rate highly) should read it first.The main character in this book is the detective Doan, and unfortunately his huge Great Dane Carstairs makes only a cameo introductory appearance.  Fortunately, in the subsequent stories Carstairs plays an integral role and adds immeasurably to the reader's enjoyment. Doan's unimpressive appearance leads his adversaries to underestimate his (and Carstairs') skill and intelligence, and in this introduction to his character the author has not yet fully developed Doan's skills. However, it is still a typical pulp fiction story concerning a hard boiled detective except for the fact that as the author developed the characters over the series he injected much more humor than was usual for that era.After an interesting introduction to the series' characters in the first few chapters, Doan is tasked to protect a young heiress about to receive her inheritance. He travels to a wilderness resort cabin, and becomes isolated there with a strange cast of characters while a blizzard rages outside. However,  murders occur, misdirection abounds, and of course he eventually untangles the web of deceit, earning his keep and rescuing a damsel in distress.. As in all short stories of this type, the prose is spare and the character development minimal. But a fast pace keeps the reader's interest.Unfortunately,  the author Norbert Davis is not as well known as other pulp fiction writers of the period for three reasons. First, his stories encompassed a wide array of genres, so he never built a reputation as a practitioner  of specific type (e.g. detective, SF, etc.) . Second, his detective stories included a strain of humor which was highly unusual for the period, a hard boiled detective story was not supposed to be funny. Third, he committed suicide at age 40, supposedly after he had been diagnosed with cancer. Thus, his potential literary legacy was truncated. However, among his peers he was regarded as in a class with the best writers of the era, including Hammett and McDonald. He graduated from Stanford with a law degree, but never took the bar exam - choosing instead to pursue a career which he had already established by being published while still in college, usually being paid at the going rate of a penny a word. Hopefully, the advent of ebooks and specialized small presses will allow many more potential fans to enjoy his works and be delighted by Carstairs' collaborations with Doan.Also, after reading this short story you can decide if you agree with me that the author's choice of title was very clever due to the multiple images invoked.Tucker Andersen 6/4/2010",3,1

"The Guardians was certainly not bad. It was well worth its price, and made for a great read.The characters were pretty well developed, each with a distinctive personality, except for Duke Angaria, who just came across as hateful. The guardians were all well developed. You either liked them (Atock and Enton) or didn't like them (Phillip). Whether you liked them or not, they all added to the book. Cassandra also made for a nice addition to the cast, though she played a minor role. The characters have a lot of growing to do, but in a several book series, that should be accomplished easily.Kelcer doesn't make much sense in this book, though I hope in the next book, he will be described more.The religious satire in this book is a nice touch with historical parts like the Inquisition, and Censorship. Though they have yet to be built upon, with at least four books they probably will be.The Plot is pretty good, with an interesting first half. Some of the time at Mul-Dune is boring, but towards the end it picks up and finishes with a bang. The death of Callin and Murleen was a nice touch, we got to meet them and feel for them.All in all it's a pretty good book. It doesn't excel, with a lot to be built upon, but makes for an interesting read.",4,1

"At age fifty; Samantha Sweet&#8217;s dream was to own a bakery featuring cakes, cookies, and cupcakes.  Currently, she was doing her baking at home under less than ideal conditions.  Until she saved enough money to accomplish that she worked part time for a government agency cleaning and maintaining homes that had gone into default.  Her job was to get them into shape to be sold.One day, she found a very ill, very unusual woman lying in bed in one of the houses.  The woman gave Sam a box which she said had special powers, then she died.  When she was mowing the yard at the next house, she discovered an unidentified grave.  Both those finds play major roles in SWEET MASTERPIECE.Her new powers give her more energy and the ability to see things others cannot.  The body in the grave is that of a recluse, an elderly man who turned out to have been a famous painter.  The sheriff&#8217;s department initially believes he may have died from pneumonia or another natural cause.While the book was a fast read and well-written, I found the plot to be very thin.  There were some very good descriptions of various locations.  It had a lot of filler material about making cakes and cupcakes (no recipes were provided) and an overview, repeated several times, of what Sam did to prepare a house.The book has a lot of characters, primarily some of Sam&#8217;s long-time friends.  She talks about her daughter Kelly who cleaned out Sam&#8217;s savings.  Later the daughter returns but the story doesn&#8217;t give enough details about why she quit her job or why she suddenly changed.Another main character is the sheriff, Beau Cardwell.  The relationship between him and Sam moves too quickly without explanation of Beau&#8217;s motivation.Overall, I found the book to be boring because of all the surface attention given to Sam&#8217;s jobs. It might have made a better short story.This book was a free Amazon download.",2,0
"I first read this book about 50 years ago, and I enjoyed it as much now as I did then. I couldn't have realized at that time, that I was  reading a precursor to MacGyver, Lost, Lassie, and countless other books, movies and TV shows. Jules Verne was a genius, and his writing style was absolutely delightful. Unfortunately a book worded thus today would realize only the sale of about ten copies. (I tried to imitate his style. It didn't work.)",5,1
"This book has several stories in one. The principal character and her love interest are meant to be together, but a teenage crush put their romance on hold for years. Both principles have family and friends join in the story and the reader can be overwhelmed by the number of characters.That aside, I enjoyed the book. Free on Kindle. I recommend this book but warn readers there are a lot of stories within and around the main characters. One can easily end a chapter with one set of characters and not get back to their story for a couple of chapters, and at the same time those characters are mentioned in the other romance stories.Confused yet?

"Elain Pardie is a news reporter.  On assignment covering the First Annual Arcadia Highland Games, she is concerned to find a lost black dog while leaving.  Finding no one to claim him, Elain agrees to take him home with the hopes of finding his owner.  She has no idea that the huge furry dog is not actually a dog but a wolf. Nor does she even think to consider that the wolf is not a canine but a man.  When the dog's owners show up to claim their lost pet, Elain is sad to see him go but returns him anyway.  The next day, she receives a phone call from one of the owners inviting her to lunch.  When she meets the man, she is surprised to see he is a twin and that both men are luscious. Allowing them liberties she never even could have considered, Elain's life changes the minute they touch her.Ain, Brodey, and Cail are identical alpha triplets.  As such, fate tells of only one woman for the three men to love - their soul mate.  When Brodey smells an enticing scent at the Highland Games, he can't help but follow it.  He knows that Ain, the Prime of the three will be angry, but he is willing to take that chance because if his nose is correct, then he has just found the woman nature has intended to complete his family.I found myself laughing out loud at the antics of Brodey and Cail.  Ain was the oldest and the most intense.  Brodey was the most playful of the three, and Cail seemed the happiest.  All three were sin personified and simply dreamy.  Ain's emotions concerning Elain worried me at first - he was so stubborn in wanting Elain to love them on her own terms and by her own choice.  Ain's willingness to sacrifice a lifetime of being unmated rather than force Elain to mate with he and brothers grabbed my heart and didn't let go.TROUBLE COMES IN THREES is sexy, scorching hot, and fun to read.  Tymber Dalton's ability to weave a story keeps me coming back for more and reading everything she releases.  Lovers of paranormal m&eacute;nage romances with a hint of comedy should run and grab this enticing book.  It was great!Natalie S.",5,1

"I've been an occasional reader of the Wall Street Journal for many years, but had never really considered subscribing to it. For the most part I've been happy to get my news for free online from a variety of sources, but of late I've been craving a more consistent access to the kind of high quality news stories that WSJ is known for. I decided to check out several subscription options, and compare them to each other. The Kindle version, even though it is very limited in many respects, turns out to be pretty good and in line with my expectations for what I wanted to get out of reading WSJ.Once you subscribe to WSJ, you can setup the delivery to any one of your Kindle devices or enabled Kindle readers. You can also manually download the current issue of WSJ to another device, but the automatic downloads are enabled for only one device at the time (you can change which one in the online Kindle setting at any time). Kindle formatting of WSJ leaves a lot to be desired. As you may imagine, the reading experience will be much closer to reading a book than a newspaper. I don't mind this all that much, as WSJ has always been a pretty text-heavy newspaper. The exceptions are the graphs and charts, which can be almost illegible when presented on Kindle. The sections and articles are well organized and easily accessible through the menu, and I am overall pleased with the navigation options. In terms of formatting, I still prefer the dedicated WSJ iPad version, but the Kindle version gets the job done.One big difference between the Kindle version and those for various tablets is that you won't be able to access various embedded videos on Kindle (not even in the tablet version of Kindle software). Those small video clips are indeed a lot of fun, and definitely add to the overall ""reading"" experience. However, they also add to the size of the download, and unless you have a really fast wireless connection and the latest version of the tablet, the download can be choppy. For me these videos are a nice addition, but they are not crucial.As far as the price goes, yes, Wall Street Journal on Kindle is kind of expensive. However, keep in mind that you can in principle cancel your subscription without much trouble after any number of months has passed, something that in my experience is not that easy to pull off with a print subscription of any newspaper. I do consider WSJ to be a very high quality publication, and in my opinion the price is reasonable for the kind of content and convenience that you get. We've all been spoiled by the years of de-facto free online access to various newspapers and magazines, but unfortunately this free-for-all state of affairs has lead many fine journals and newspapers to shut down.If you are seeking the convenience and the ease of use that the Kindle version of WSJ provides, and are not too concerned with the formatting and various bells and whistles, then I'd definitely recommend that you check it out. So far I've been more satisfied than I had expected based on all the negative reviews that I have read.",4,1
"I read Stealing Innocence I and enjoyed it overall and decided to give II a try.  Three weeks later (highly unusual for me) I am only halfway through II.  The plot, though a bit far-fetched is interesting but the grammatical errors are discouraging and make this publication hard to keep reading.  I will finish it because I can't wait to see how the story progresses but do all of her books have the excessive amount of grammatical errors?  I hope someone will answer this for me and by all means let me know if her publications improve.  I'd like to read other titles by her but only if the errors have improved.",3,1
"This story serves as a vehicle for the author's message and, as vehicles go, it's the equivalent of a base model -- there's a story, but it isn't original or interesting.Abby is a scientist and, since she's in a Christian story, she's on a collision path with events destined to show her that science can't explain everything, blah blah blah blah.  Of course, her closed-minded peers can't handle this, so she is ridiculed by everyone except for her kindly professor.  Eventually she has a chance to be a true hero of faith and so on.

It is also apparently a follow up to at least one other novel by Showalter, though I didn't feel like I was missing much in the backstory by starting here.  I feel like this story might have been better as perhaps a longer novella though - for those just starting out in the world, it is a rather brief number of pages to get acquainted with the world and its characters.

"John Galsworthy (1867-1933) was a very popular writer at the turn of the 20th Century.  He was the son of a wealthy lawyer and studied law at Oxford. He became a solicitor in 1890 but never practiced law.  Instead he used his father's wealth to travel and learn about writing fiction from talented authors including Joseph Conrad.In the Forsyte Chronicles, Galsworthy created the history of an extended family that begins in the Victorian era in Britain in the early 1800s, extends through the Eduardian Era in the latter decades of the 1800s, and ends after World War I during the British social and economic turmoil of the 1920s.The Chronicles, now called the Forsyte Saga, is a trilogy of novels: The Man Of Property (1906), In Chancery (1920), and To Let (1921).  The fist in the series sets the stage with wealth earned through the driving motivation of land ownership by the founding fathers of the Forsyte family.  The actors on the stage have landed riches and establish social networks as cohesive as the royal family in England.  Even their relationships are governed by the limits of ownership.  Women are the property of their husbands and accept their roles with the reward of financial security.In Chancery describes the continued accumulation of wealth of the family obtained through careful management of money increasingly independent of private property. There is an unwritten family rule of 4% return on all investments. Social conventions begin to change in the story with the problems brought on by allowing outsiders into the family's closed system through marriages. The women become somewhat rebellious refusing to accept many of the subservient roles that were accepted in the early generation Forsytes.To Let traces the family's fortunes through the turn of the 20th Century as the newer generations begin to consume rather than generate family wealth. This is a time of social and legal conflicts for the family that disrupt the order of their traditional lives.  The focus gradually changes to the youngest members of the family who, because of the devastating effects of the World War, believe that there is more to life than hoarding of riches, commodities that can disappear quickly.  These Forsytes pursue artistic and social justice activities and use the family money to go their own ways. The 4% rule is not forgotten, but rather never known by the youngsters.I first read the Forsyte Chronicles paperbacks in the early 1970s as a young man just out of the U. S. Army after the Vietnam War.  I enjoyed reading and experiencing the stability of the family and social structure of British society in the novels, a real contrast to my life then in California.  I identified with the last generations of Forsytes in To Let, focusing on their individual self actualizing choices.After rereading the trilogy on my Kindle1, I now identify with the more conservative earlier generations of Forsytes described in The Man of Property and In Chancery. I appreciated the change of perspective as I approach retirement, and I gained insight through a life review by proxy. I can relate the work to other great generational novels depicting the turn of the 20th Century, such as Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks.The world is much more interactive now than it was in the Forsyte's mystical Great Britain, and social stress has taken on global proportions.  But the activities of making a living, maintaining family stability, and attempting to reach personal satisfaction remain great themes for the turn of the 21st Century.  I highly recommend the Forsyte saga to readers (especially Kindle readers) who will see that the endless cycles of social life continue and personal development is a product of these social rhythms.",5,1
"I really wanted to give a higher rating... I really did. The truth is the writing is superb, the storyline is interesting, character development is well done, sex scenes are plentiful, and it has the dark elements I love. So, why? It's sooo long. Don't misunderstand; I read fast so I enjoy a long book but I don't enjoy books that say in three paragraphs what you can say in three sentences. To say this novel is verbose is a gross understatement. I read a lot of erotica and this is the first time I've ever read a sex scene described to death. It just went on and on and on to the point where I felt so out of the moment it was more like reading a how to manual. The entire book was like that--every scene described in exacting detail to the point of boredom. Cut the word count in half and this would've been a great book. Such a shame.",2,0

"Well where should I start ..... I finished reading Board Resolution and the wonder that someone could write such a combination of a nebulous teenage wet dream and the fantasies of every inadequate woman hater was overwhelming.The premise that a woman who was as powerful and masterful in a male dominated world of high finance could be reduced to some trembling and sexually desperate slave was such a stretch for my human mind to begin with that I could hardly believe that the author would push me even farther into fantasy land with the thought that a bit of date rape combined with a most creative gang-bang which would be ""just what she needed"" just pushed me over the edge of any possibility to see this as anything more than literary porn written to appeal to men with inadequate equipment and women with severe mental problems.I should pause for a moment to make sure you understand that I am not a fan of erotica (much less BDSM). The reason has nothing to do with the sex but much to do with the fact that almost all of it (with a few notable exceptions) is poorly written, has little if anything resembling a plot outside of writing about sex in various incarnations and generally reduces the characters to little more than what can be done in the erogenous areas between ones legs. The writings of Larissa Ione are more to my speed in this area since she weaves her erotic scenes into an overall plot that while including sex in various forms have an end game that includes more than an orgasm.Back to the story at hand, our dual personality heroine Savannah, who apparently can run a billion dollar corporation but has the need to be date raped and treated like a piece of meat by Matthew Lord Kensington (ya gotta love that name) and brought to the pinnacle of self awareness by a gang-bang of sorts with his buddies. I know what you are thinking, ""What a fantastic love story"" &lt; sarcasm/off> but somewhere along the way anything resembling reality checked out and it might as well have been Star Trek porn (and the actions of this version of ""Scotty the engineer"" are about as impossible as getting that extra bit of warp drive).The HEA of this makes my head spin since I would have tasered his ass on about page 11 and end of story or if I let things play out in this nightmarish scenario, the next step should have been Savannah getting a sexy 40 caliber Glock and polishing these boys off this earth. Apparently, my naivety in the world of BDSM did not realize the proper reaction is to be grateful to the rapists and fall madly in love with one of them. Such is this story and since I don't have a number smaller than the national debt to measure the incredulity of this story all I can say is that it does have a ""train wreck"" appeal but any lasting compulsion to read it again would have me wondering if my secret desire is to become a serial rapist.",2,0
"The writing was good and definitely pumped up the steam, but it's definitely not for the faint of heart. Be warned to expect m/m m/f and m/f/m but judging by the description you probably already figured that out. I would have liked to have had the story elaborated further and had a little more background for the characters and the world the story takes place but this is a great set up for more in the series and there weren't any moments when I was questioning anything in the story. Overall it was a good well rounded read with interesting characters that worked well in the short novella format.",4,1
"I thought this was a good story.  Liked the main characters.  For some reason, I thought Jane should have been a brunette.  Not sure why.  Even though i'd like to move on the the next books, I can't.  The books are so short and add the rest of the series and it's terribly expensive for such short stories, combined.",3,1
"I picked up this book free during an Amazon giveaway. When pharmaceutical rep Lewis inherits his uncle's bookstore in tiny Eureka, California, he and his super-materialistic wife Emily go to look at it and are astounded at its profitability in the post-paper-books world. But how long before they discover that its earnings have nothing to do with books?I could not get into this book at all. The characters are so one-dimensional and uninteresting that the clever plotline is wasted. I gave up a third of the way through.",3,1
"It was a good short predictable story.  It developed the characters well enough to where you understand their personalities, but I don't think that it is worth $5 for the amount of storyline that is written.  There are still some editing issues, but not enough to make a big stink.",3,1
"This book is a good start to the trilogy. The author develops the world and the characters in it well. Both main characters were likeable, but the problem was that I really didn't feel any passion between them. They could have simply been buddies with no intimate relationship and it wouldn't have affected the story. I was very disappointed with that aspect of the book.Regardless of the fact i found the characters lacked chemistry the story is unique and flowed nicely. I would consider reading more of the series.",3,1
This is such a sad story. Kelly is married but her marriage is over. Her husband hadn't left her because she's dying. Gary isn't faithful to Kelly and started cheating on her before she found out she had a tumor.Tyler is a man who is fighting his own demons. Once he meets Kelly there's a pull between them. They are attracted to each other but Tyler won't destroy anyones marriage. He just doesn't know that Kelly is dying but has been dead inside for a while. Tyler's also going through the motions everyday because a tragedy in his past.I cried as I read this book. This is a story about someone dying but finally living and loving for the first time. It's also about living life to the fullest without fears and loving without holding anything back.This was a very hard book for me to get through because I've known people who have battled with cancer. Some have won their battles while others have lost it. The last few chapters were so hard to get through.This book was written in such a beautiful way it was hard to put down. It's a very heart wrenching story. I've read 2 other books by Maria Rachel Hooley and they both made me cry.I have to say the ending was beautiful. I didn't expect it to end the way it did. I was happy with the ending Tyler and Kelly got. They had a beautiful love story and a great ending. I highly recommend this book.,5,1
"""Pathogens simply can't survive in a pH balanced body."" ~Amy MosherLately I've been reading a lot of health books and they all seem to be telling me the same thing. This one had a slightly different angle however and teaches you a bit about how all diseases seem to have the same ""underlying conditions."" Acidity is apparently bad.What robs our bodies of calcium?Why should you take magnesium?Why are diet drinks worse than regular carbonated beverages?What is the real reason sugar is so bad for you?Why should you not drink a ton of water with meals?Amy Mosher answers these questions and more. I felt her book was very detailed and gave me insight into what it takes to be healthy. There are also lists of foods to eat and lists of what to eat less of or avoid. I feel this book helped to put some pieces of the health puzzle together for me. I think you will enjoy it.""Lemons are acidic but inside the body they are alkalizing."" ~ Amy MosherOne thing the author does recommend is taking wormwood.

"This work was Journey to the Center of the Earth. Just the other day, I realized I had never read it. I loved the old movie and being the reader that I am, I could not believe my neglect.This is the translation of the Jules Verne original and I must say, at times the reading is rough. It was written and translated long ago so some of the words are...confusing as well as sentence structure and meaning. But even through all that I still enjoyed the read. I did find the main character a bit childish, whinney and silly and very self centered. I put it down to the day and age that the book was written. An enjoyable classic that I will probably never read again but glad I did read it once. I would recommend to all to read at least once in your lifetime.",3,1

"I loved this prequel. There was just enough to keep you interested and get you HOOKED. There was a lot of emotions that it brought up, such as sadness, abandonment, and laughter at some of the things she would say. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in the Soul Screamers series, and anyone who is looking for a light, quick read. Very interesting and Very, Very good.",5,1
"Plot/Storyline: 4 3/4 StarsThe clever crafting of these storylines shows an unbound imagination combined with high intelligence on the part of Mr. Tuttle. Each of the stories has a unique plot with interesting resolutions.My favorite was the first one. Having it first in the collection was a great idea as I think it did the best job of introducing the two main characters and how they played off of each other.The central theme throughout all three is basically ""Use brains, not brawn."" The author sticks to that concept in interesting ways.The sense of humor I have come to expect from Mr. Tuttle is present in each story making for a very fun read.I would have liked a little more background to better understand the vow taken by Wistril, how it was enforced, etc.Character Development: 4 StarsThere was a ""Forward"" included that introduced Wistril and his apprentice, Kern. While helpful, I have always felt that stories should speak for themselves.I didn't expect as much character development in the first two shorter works. The third one was much longer and should have given us more insight, especially into Wistril's motivations.Writing Style: 5 StarsMr. Tuttle's writing style is an absolute joy to read. His humor and vocabulary, which includes some words that won't be found in Webster's, make his work shine.Editing/Formatting: 4 1/2 StarsThere were a few editing errors, but not so numerous as to spoil the mood. The formatting was good except for a couple of line breaks in odd places.Rating: G for everyone",4,1

"For bargain Kindle shoppers this 2nd generation Belkin case may be your only bet as none of the cases or sleeves are cheap for the latest generation.  I, for one, didn't feel like spending half of what the Kindle itself cost on a mere foam square, so I went ahead and tried my luck with this.  Here's what I found.The first thing to note is that my only real need for a case was to keep my Kindle from getting damaged.  Form-fitting and trendy looks weren't really important to me as long as my Kindle was kept safe.  With that state of mind, this case does a fine job.  There is a clear inch or more on all sides, so it WILL move around which is a little annoying.  I'll be honest, it moves around a little more than I had hoped.  Nothing will be damaged because it's all soft n' squishy in there, but still, when I'm carrying it around I don't like it sloshing back and forth.  The most annoying thing though is that the Kindle 3 is much skinnier than the 2nd gen. so there's also a goodly amount of open space in the girth of the case.  What this means is that it will move around side to side, back and forth, up and down, against every wall of the case.  Again, no damage will occur, and it will do an absolutely fine job at keeping the Kindle 3 safe, but it is a bit irksome.  Not enough that I want to spend the 25+ on the correct case, but if I had more money to spare I probably would.~THE GOOD THING ABOUT EXTRA ROOM~As other reviewers have noted, that extra wiggle room can actually be a blessing.  Form-fitting cases don't usually allow any extra space for storing earbuds or usb memory or whatever other tiny gadget you may want to keep with your Kindle.  With this 2nd generation case, there's more than enough room to toss in an earbud or two without any problem, and doing so may actually keep your Kindle more stationary in there.~Also~I bought mine used, obviously, but fortunately my seller was offering the product brand new, which meant it came with a thin removable Kindle-sized foam shipping pad inside the case.  This padding was meant to be removed after purchase, but if you are using a Kindle 3 I actually think it might be a good idea to hang on to it.  The extra padding drastically reduces the amount of open space and actually makes the Kindle 3 fit almost perfectly girth-wise.  Side-to-side there will still be loose room, but with the Kindle fitting more snugly it will barely move around at all.All in all, I'm very happy.  I have an AMAZING e-reader that will now avoid damage as I carry it to and fro.",4,1
"Unbridled takes place in Texas, in a town that is amusingly called Two Mule. This well written novella is full of details. The characters are all true ranching Texans. Dani is a believable character, that is easy to like. The men in this book are sexy cowboys through and through. Rowe is a hard worker while Justin was always a hard player. The differences make each one appealing in their own way. The sex scenes are very erotic. This is not the story of a traditional love, but it is just as strong and romantic. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes hot Texans! - Ammie",4,1

"Dangerous Deception by Katie Reus was a fast and fairly good read. Sage & Trent had a hot, yet brief affair before Sage ran away & left Trent in alone in the middle of the night. Fast forward two years later and Sage & Trent meet once again as Sage is working for Trent's brother. Now that Trent has finally found Sage again, he is not letting her go & is determined to to let her know that. However, complications arise when a stalker from Sage's past tracks her down and Trent is not just standing around doing nothing. He is intent on protecting her & once this is over, he is determined to keep the woman he lost once.Overall, Dangerous Deception was a fast, sexy, and light read. The pace was fast and the characters were fairly well-developed as well as the plot & storyline. Although this storyline is cliche, I still recommend it for those looking for a light & sexy read that is not too heavy.",3,1
"Hummm...Fraternal Polyandry- The practice of more than one brother being married to one woman.  Yes it is real and does happen in some countries. I had heard about this in a Social Science class in college, but have never seen it as a theme in a love story. I guess if you like the idea, then go for it. I had always thought of myself as open minded, but the polyandry combined with sexual activity with a really heavily pregnant woman took me out of my comfort zone. I rated this one as  two stars overall because it does make you think. As far as being a love story or romantic, I would only give it one star just because it is not in my comfort zone.",2,0
"If you are interested in reading a book that only has sex in it with no clear plotline beyond segueing into more sex, than by all means, this book is for you.  However, if you are interested in love and romance, steer clear because this book is not what you are looking for.  I am an avid reader of all things romance, and I, too, can appreciate well written love scenes.  Unfortunately for me, this book had nothing more to offer.",1,0
"And worth every penny I spent on it.  I suppose it's a pleasant-enough story in the Harlequin-romance vein. Don't count on much suspense here though.  It's mostly a story of a marriage of convenience becoming one of True Love.  Hero Jonas, who owns a bar in Key West, needs a wife so that it will look like he's providing a stable, ""traditional"" family life for his orphaned 5-year-old niece, whom he has cared for 3 years or so.  Heroine Pam is from Seattle, on the run from a killer who she believes wants to kill her so that she can't testify in his upcoming re-trial.  (She already had testified in his first trial.)  So she agrees to marry Joe to be able to change her name and hide out.  (Yeah, I know.  What a great idea.)Pam is an uptight architect, not used to children or a laid-back style of living.  We have her predictable evolution from prissy lady to Key West kind of gal and we see her maternal instincts eventually come out to deal with the 5 year old.  (A child who is far more advanced, verbal and aware than my grandchildren were at that age.  Well, maybe people in my family aren't very bright.) So we've got Pam's emotional makeover, the Joe-Pam love thing, and the hit man subplot (which is kind of subpar).  It's an OK read but isn't something you should pay for.",2,0

"I began by reading the first in the series ""Dark Wolf Rising"" and immediately fell in love with the main characters as well as the others.

"The first book in the Infinion series established a good and original premise which had me anticipating the release of this sequel.  Book two begins 26 years in the future from the previous book just a few weeks from the approach of the series' all-important date Nov. 11, 2011.  It rapidly becomes clear that the Three Eleven Corporation has had an even more profound impact on the world in the last two and a half decades.  The beginning of the book offers some answers and builds good anticipation of what is going to happen between several of the central characters.  Unfortunately, many of these interactions fall flat.  Much was made in the first book of Adya's (Dawn's) call to motherhood and her extremely high IQ.  Although she has the education and experience of a master parent she is portrayed as a terrible mother in this second installment.  She seems very distant from her children, especially with the most important one who she neglects throughout the book.  I also got an overall impression that fatherhood is treated as inconsequential.  Dawn spends a good deal of the book pushing her lover completely out of her life while lamenting his distance.  Strange biases creep into the narrative.  At one point a character applauds himself thinking of himself as: ""leaving behind typical Caucasian ignorance.""  Not too subtle there.  And this guy is supposed to be a good guy, who happens to be Caucasian!Although the world's fateful day is approaching, it is hard to determine the passage of time here.  People are flying all over the world from this location to that location, often with little purpose or some obscure purpose.  It gives a very disjointed feel to the flow of the narrative when the reader is not sure why the characters are heading somewhere or what their next move should be.  At one point something happens that it would seem pretty important that the central characters react to but it seems not to be pursued to its natural conclusion at all.  During these tumultuous times for the planet, Dawn, the leader of Three Eleven essentially goes AWOL a couple of times during the book simply because she's upset about things going on.  She completely withdraws and provides no confidence to the rest of the Executive.  Three Eleven was ominous enough in the first book, but now has become terrifyingly powerful.  The corporation has effectively become a world government in the form of global nanny state controlling people's entertainment, food, money, technology, et cetera.  They are still presented as the good guys but they seem to have no redeeming qualities.  They keep people from having much junk food, or the latest technology.  The average person doesn't need the good stuff, right?  They may be trying to save the world but it is no longer a world people are free in.  Despite this the vast majority of the populace seems to be enthralled with the unrestricted intrusion of the corporation into most facets of their lives, to the point that many still express a desire to work for them!  The major exceptions to this are a man who blows things up and a crack pot conspiracy theorist.I am disappointed in the plot here.  We do learn much more about the plasmid and the threat to Earth and these things have some cool ideas thrown in there.  The concept has so much potential and even some new elements with much potential continue to be introduced here to Bell's credit.  But these are not able to overcome the fractured storytelling, deeply flawed characterizations, and scattered plot.  The train really flies off the tracks when Dawn goes and visits the buffalo spirits.  No, that's not a joke.  I'm a bit of a completist, so I'll still read the final installment for closure but it won't be with nearly the anticipation of this one.",2,0

"Described as ""a collection of short stories told from a different character's involvement and point of view,"" this is actually a linnear novella in which the POV changes from chapter to chapter. None of it was particularly great. Just a very surface description of some bloody conflict between the seelie and unseelie courts during a fancy ball, with almost no background, engaging characterizations, or engaging dialogue.I acquired this some months ago, and in the meantime Farrell has released a novel based on it, entitled Soul. I believe it was only after the publication of Soul that this shorter work began to be listed as a ""Prequel companion"", and it's not exactly that, as the events described in it mirror events that take place in Soul.In my opinion, having now read two novels and two ""short story collections"" (one of which actually was a short story collection!) by Farrell, as well as the first chapter of Soul, perhaps Farrell should stick to novels. The longer format provides the obviously-needed room to develop interesting characters. One Night with the Fae lacks in this area, and pretty much reads like an author's outline for a longer work.",2,0
"Since being offered on the Kindle, I've purchased one or two issues of the International Herald Tribune.  It's a good paper, with a broad international perspective.  Just be aware that it's mainly a compilation newspaper that pulls its stories and features from the world's prominent newspapers and news sources, including many you may already subscribe to on your Kindle.  But if you don't already get items like the New York Times Latest News blog and some of the dollar-a-month wire service news blogs (or won't mind the slight redundancy in articles if you do), go for it.  Like the handful of other Kindle newspapers I've experienced, the Kindle edition of the International Herald Tribune is laid out well, is easy to navigate, and features a generous allotment of photographs.  I'd be tempted to buy it more often, or maybe even subscribe, if the subscription and/or single-issue price was just a bit lower.  But, of course, that won't be an issue with everyone.Note: Amazon frequently updates the presentation and functionality of Kindle blogs and periodicals, so as this review gets older, it may no longer accurately describe the current version of this product.",4,1
"I didn't enjoy this one. If I can be honest, I don't enjoy the writing style as much as book 1. I like the narrator's voice, but considering this book was written in a four person POV, the narrator didn't even bother trying to differentiate the voices. I ended up rewinding a few times to see who was talking since it featured Zach & Angelo and Matt & Jared. My enjoyment of this series really plummeted with this book.This book started with Zach giving Angelo a free pass to be with another man, with the agreement that Angelo come home to him afterwards. Considering how hard they fought to be together 4 months ago, I was surprised that Angelo would quickly jump at the opportunities.The main problem that I had was that Angelo throws a conniption fit if someone looks sideways at Zach. It just seems hypocritical, and I was unsure of Zach's true motivations for allowing the free pass. If I really got why, I might have been able to accept it more.I completely with Jonathan's assessment that it would appear that they had an open relationship, but it only works one way. I mean, Angelo is getting a handjob on a public dancefloor in front of Zach, but Angelo attacks Jonathan for kissing Zach. Can you say hypocrite?I don't think Jonathan owed Angelo an apology, maybe an explanation but Angelo didn't even have the decency to offer  Jonathan an apology and explanation back. Angelo was just a taker and Zach a doormat in this book, and I didn't like it at all.Jared and Matt have been together for a little over a year, but Matt talked about how going all the way felt wrong. I am confused. In the prior books it seemed like they couldn't get enough, but Matt explains they do &#34;other stuff&#34;. I want to know if Matt is really gay because his feeling of guilt or that it doesn't &#34;feel right&#34; should concern Jared.I just don't get these relationships. I know everyone has what works for them, but right now, neither couple's interactions are working for me.  I will try one more book in this series before I give it up.",2,0

"The Jynx is the 4th novel I've read in my Kenneth C. Crowe marathon.  Once again I enjoyed the story.  A small bit of the supernatural does not deter me from awarding a well deserved 5 stars. A common man with somewhat uncommon intelligence seems to get into situations that can elevate him into  a life of celebrity  Crowe's protagonist is, once again, as in his other books, endowed with qualities that make him likable to this reader.  These are not serials.  Each stands on its own and the characters are fresh and exclusive.  I cannot identify a moral to this story, just as I can't say that there are no similarities with his other storylines; the ones I've read featuring a clean living protagonist whose politics lean a bit to the left and who are not adverse to a roll in the hay with a lusty female.  There's manipulation, greed, lies, and deceit. Jynx comes closest to &#34;he lived happily ever after&#34; ! ! !",5,1
"Ok... here's the thing.  I'm going to do my best not to include any spoilers, but I'm definitely going to be referencing some stuff that happens later in the book because I could see where things were headed by the time I was halfway through the book.For the first third of the book we have this AWESOME chemistry between Rori and Jude and then I get to cheer for her because she refuses to be treated like a piece of meat, the way Jude normally treats his women.  Seriously, what's with these other chicks that they're totally okay jumping him that afternoon and then seeing him out on a date with Rori that evening and then go so far as to proposition him in front of her?  Although at least that gave Rori the heads up that no matter how hot Jude is in bed, she deserves a better MAN outside of it.Enter Zach... hurrah!  Rori's biggest sexy time connection with Jude was that she discovered she's submissive and she was really turned on by his dominant side.  Zach is yet another sexy dominant who is smitten with Rori, but Zach has no problem being an amazing, romancing relationship guy.  I totally started to fall for him and then I remembered that this book is called ""Second Chances"" and that the blurb mostly talks about Jude.At which point I start going oh eff no, because Zach is too possessive for this to be a sharing book.Suffice to say, figuring out halfway through the book exactly how Jude was going to be positioned to get a second chance, and then having his second chance with Rori being RUSHED through the last third of the book, I did not come away satisfied.  There's not enough time spent on Jude's reformation and there's not enough connection between him and Rori to satisfy me.  I felt the strongest connection with Zach and yet we already know before reading that that relationship isn't ultimately going anywhere, which makes it really hard to get invested in it.By the time I got to the last third of the book I was really emotionally detached from everything that was going on because I couldn't connect with Zach anymore and I didn't want to connect again with Jude, who had been such an a$$ throughout 2/3 of the book.Dane's written much better stuff.  Honestly, I can't recommend this one.  I'd try one of her other titles unless you've already bought everything else she has to offer and absolutely MUST read every single thing she's ever written.",2,0

"Every child should read 20,000 leagues under the sea, a classic adventure.

There are a classic few books that in my viewpoint children should be exposed to Tom Sawyer (and its sequel Huckleberry Finn), Last of the Mohicans, Animal Farm,  The Hobbit, Tarzan, Harry Potter, A Yankee in King Arthurs Court...This book is not as good as 20,000 Leagues but if their interest has been peaked tehy may stll wade through this novel and reading these classics is by far a better activity for children than video games.",4,1

"I probably wouldn't have bought this book if it hadn't been listed for $.99, but I'm so glad I gave it a chance! It was worth every penny and now I want to read all the other books in the series. Chase Dagger, Sara and Einstein make a great detective team with good character development and budding chemistry, and the mystery was a fun page turner, if a tad predictable. Slight spoiler - while I'm a tad creeped out by the age difference (he's 35, she's 18) I'm hoping the author will give her a few years to grow up before taking the storyline that way. Can we get all of these on Kindle please?",5,1
"Or just a Christmas romance to make you crack-up! The opening scene in the book is a mishap that pretty much sets the tone throughout the whole book, and yes many of us can relate. The main thing about any of these romances is that there are a number of lies and misrepresentations throughout. Is there such a thing as a romance that's honest from beginning to end?Okay I loved this story so much that I really don't care, but I think it's sad. Anyhow this book was heartwarming and funny! I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a nice holiday read!",5,1
"Dominant Species spends a few pages introducing us to a Marine major and his crack team of specialists and then drops them on a rebellious mining world to break open a fuel depot for an incoming invasion force. Which goes really well until they fall down a mine shaft into a deep cavern occupied by a mysterious, ancient ship. The book follows their race for survival against odds that only continue to mount against them....In short, you pick up this book and once you get past the first couple of chapters' worth of set-up, you don't put it down until the characters are safe at the other side. This is great military SF: non-stop action, great tech (there was some serious thought put into their power armor) and an unexpected plot to boot. The author has a pretty impressive background, too; seriously, his other available book is The Emergency Responder's Guide to Terrorism. That's not fiction, mind.I read some of the reviews left about this book and was puzzled by them. Some people complained there wasn't enough character development, and I wondered: good Lord, in what time? People who are trying desperately not to die don't exactly have time for deep conversations about their feelings. This book is solid action from beginning to end: you read it for the same reason you get on a roller coaster, for the adrenaline high. Dominant Species definitely delivers.I did have a couple of quibbles: the author confuses ""it's"" and ""its,"" which is tiresome if you're sensitive to grammar; years of reading forum posts have inoculated me against outrage so it didn't bother me. There were also some wordos (the author liked to use the word ""prosaic"" when he really meant ""poetic"" for instance). And the title is a little misleading given the plot. Otherwise, I found it quite enjoyable.If you're looking for a novel that reads like a summer blockbuster action flick, complete with awesome gadgets and cool extrapolations of future tech, you have got to pick this one up. You can sample it and see if you like it. The whole book's only $1.99. Cup of coffee or several hundred pages of explosions... doesn't seem like a hard choice to me. :)",3,1
Flat and stale portrayal with unappealing storyline.  More of a rip off than an enjoyable story or titillating tale. Save your money.,1,0

"I've picked this up a few times,  but it never manages to hold my attention. There is no tension,  nothing really to explore or find out.  It's too sweet and mawkish.  I've never finished it and this is my 3rd attempt,  so it gets 2 stars from me.",2,0

Forster's writing is entertaining and fast paced. This one with murder and drama but a little short on court room drama, none the less, an excellent read.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",4,1

"The one and two star reviews about sum up my opinion of this book so I won't belabor the point.This is my first review and only my opinion, but I believe the author obviously is a skilled writer but this book fell flat.",1,0
"There is something strange about the ratings for this book, reading them you would think people are writing about totally different books.  When I bought the book the ratings were excellent, but now when I go back to see why on earth I ever got it, I find that in the meantime several one-star ratings have appeared, most of which I totally agree with.Already chapter 1 had me wondering, it was a totally uninteresting account of an office day, but then I was hooked by the last sentence - the main charachter was in fact a prison inmate - and I went on, thinking things would develop from there. But they never did - it was followed by equally boring detailed accounts of chemistry experiments, fishing trips, teenage partying and dating and other events that seemed totally unrelated and irrelevant.Maybe it all somehow is tied together in the end, but when the story still hadn't taken off att 28% I gave it up.The editing was also very bad with grammatical errors and typos.",1,0
"How many times is author going to get Amazon to delete this or add comments about alleged conspiracies of people out to get him? Is he f*in delusional? My review:I have to agree with a few previous reviewers. The author doesn't know the basic mechanics of writing, so how in the world is this or any other he's written full stars? There's not a page that isn't filled with grammar problems. The story itself suffers the same problems from the author's inattention to detail. Characters are inconsistent in their actions. It's like they're interchangeable pegs on a board the author puts into places when he needs them.",1,0
"This story was a great idea. I started it and was interested in how the author would work out the communication between a werewolf and a deaf human. I didn't get much out of it, to be honest. I got into it, was enjoying myself very much reading, and then the main characters met (a ""helpless"" woman meeting two huge strangers in the middle of nowhere at night) and they got cuddly that very first night. Really? And the very next morning, they reveal that not only are they werewolves, she is one too! And she thinks it's really cool. Okay, fine, I can admit that if someone told me I was a werewolf, I'd be ecstatic.But then they can't have sex. Then they HAVE to have sex. Then they're in mortal danger, and in a blink all of a sudden the helpless deaf former-human is ordering around a pack hell bent on tearing them apart. What? And all this in how many words? This could have been stretched out and developed into an amazing full-length novel. It just seems all too neat in the end. Everything that was such a huge obstacle just magically turned out to be nothing but a speed bump and the heroine just wakes up one day, her world turned upside down and she's all peachy, going along with the program like it's the most natural thing. Yeah, I don't think so.Oh and the deaf thing? Wouldn't you know it? They can speak telepathically! Isn't that convenient?",2,0

"There are a couple of things you need to consider before you buy this book.  Are you a survivalist?  Do you spend your weekends thinking up ways to survive once society collapses?  Do you keep a store of medical supplies, canned foods, and firearms and practice using them in extreme conditions?  If this is the kind of thing you enjoy doing and thinking about, then ""The Birth of the Peacekeepers."" will be great fun for you and you will find much in common with the book's protagonist.  On the other hand, if think survivalists are nutcases and nightmares of a future world with no people haunt your nights, then you will not enjoy this book in the least.",5,1

"Since I read all the books in order, I got to know the characters. This book would stand on it's own, but it is best read in the order the series is meant to be read. At this point I'm used to everybody and everything having a weird name, but it's overwhelming and distracts me when the names start to look like the author just randomly hit letters. I need to be able to imagine saying the name of something, or when it's referenced again I won't remember what it is. That's why I didn't give the book a higher rating.",3,1
"The USA Today via the Kindle is well done. We normally subscribe to the USA Today and the Washington Post. Yes you lose the color graphics but that is not a detriment if you want to read the news while traveling without having to find the paper on sale. Navigation around among the sections and the articles is very easy and intuitive. My husband had never used my Kindle and I gave it to him to read the paper and he had no problem with it.  Don't compare the USA Today with other newspapers, for the USA Today gives you just the facts and you provide your own opinion as it should be. Reading a story in the USA Today is about  the size of the exact same story in the Post but the Post provides a lot of opinion which I don't need. I form my own opinion after reading the paper. The Editorial page along with the Letters to the Editor are on the Kindle along with the sports, life, and all the world news. Great paper!!",5,1

They do get to leave together you are not sure at first if it will happen. They have a brief seperation but the HEA does happen. Each story will be the man telling how he met his wife.A very enjoyable series. If you are some one who likes a like of sex in your stories you will certainly find it here.,5,1

"This review is a bit contradictory because what I loved about this story, made it quite lacking at well.*SPOILERS*The excerpt does a good job describing the story and how the hero (Xenos) was throughout the book, I loved that he was an alien crossbreed who looked and behaved like it. So many times, I've read the 'lazy- I-don't-want-make-my-audience-uncomfortable-version' of sci-fi romances where the only things alien about the characters are their names and customs!nLike the excerpt states, Xenos is jaded and hardened emotionally and I like that the author remained true to that definition of who he was. He grew up in a lab where he was tortured, experimented on, and reared where he never had any positive emotional contact with anyone. And, because of how he looked, he was always on guard with everyone. Moonlight entered the picture, offering him her body for her mother's freedom, but she was disgusted and revolted by who he was and how he looked. Sure, her body responded to him sexually even though she hated, but he knew how she felt, so beyond the physical demands of his body, his overwhelming purpose was tied to his mission to defy his leaders and to stop the breeding and testing in the labs. So building on the sexual desire, Moonlight became interested in the Xenos the person. Now some readers might see her interest as being one-sided as she made most of the overtures in the relationship, but while I do get that sometimes as readers we want to see reciprocity to 'even' a relationship, in this case I understood why it couldn't be so. To accept the relationship, you had to remember who Xenos was, how he grew up and the events that shaped his life. He never knew love, tenderness,acceptance, or even a relationship and he also was insecure therefore all approaches had to come from Moonlight. Moonlight was strong in that she didn't need the scorecard. I thought that she took responsibility for the fact that SHE wanted him and in her internal dialogue, we see she accepted the challenges and came with being with someone who was so closed off.That being said, I think the author missed the mark with Moonlight's overall development. I didn't feel like I knew enough about her and it made her character a tad bit underwhelming.The story also focused too much on the rebellion/mission and even though Xenos and Moonlight's relationship was developing, it was merely based on their sexual compatibility. Every time they came together, it was about sex. This is my contradictory peeve, because while I like how focused the author was on maintaining Xenos character, the story ultimately is a romance, and there could've been a little more on the romance side without necessarily jeopardizing the storyline. Also, the sex scenes were very repetitive...in fact, after the first one, every other scene felt like it was cut and pasted with just a word change here and there. Xenos basically did the same things, Moonlight gasped the same words over and over!!There are a few graphic elements that a potential reader should be aware of. It's not too crazy or overly descriptive, but it is there.Finally, the end of the book left much to be desired. I felt like the author was detached from the romance side and it showed through in the end. Nevertheless, its a book that I recommend!",3,1
"Wade Peterson isn't a man to settle for just one woman - he loves them all but one woman in particular has snuck into his heart.  Despite Jessica's refusal of his proposal a year ago, he's decided that she belongs to him and he'll do whatever he has to in order to make her feel the same way about him.Jessica Evans has no illusions about who she is or what she wants in her life.  Her own background taught her that the only person she can count on is herself.  The only trouble is she has very strong feelings for Wade which no amount of denial seems to assuage.After Jessica shot down Wade's proposal he hightailed it out of San Antonio for Arizona to lick his wounds.  She'd claimed that she simply isn't the marrying kind but he's not willing to lose hope just because she's obviously scared of a commitment.  Wade approaches her at the auction stockyard where Jessica works as the manager and is hurt that she acts like she hasn't even missed him over the past year.  He's well aware of her sexual appetite and fully intends to use it to his advantage.  Jessica loves kinky sex and by having multiple partners she's been able to keep her distance emotionally - or so she thinks.  Wade can barely stomach sharing her with anyone but Clancey, Jessica's longtime friend with benefits, gives her a perceived safety net.  Wade has known Jessica since high school but he knows very little about her past and the secrets she's guarded so closely.Just when Jessica thinks she can hold Wade at bay her past comes back to haunt her and she finds herself face to face with a smaller version of herself.  Thanks to Clancy Wade had a bit of forewarning that Jessica didn't have a happy childhood but he never anticipated coming face to face with the man who made Jessica's childhood a living hell.  Is Wade prepared to accept Jessica along with all her `baggage' and can he convince her that she can trust him to never purposely hurt her - physically or emotionally?Oh my!  I have to tell you that I don't believe I can adequately express the emotional roller coaster I experienced while reading BOUND BY THE PAST.  Jessica and Wade's relationship is full of ups and downs and some unexpectedly heart wrenching scenes as Jessica has to decide if she's going to trust Wade or not.  The reason behind Jessica's refusal to allow anyone close to her is stunning and heartbreaking but it makes her a strong character and someone that women could admire.  Out of all the characters in this story it's the secondary characters who bring it to life in a truly unique way. My heart broke for Clancey.  He's suffered his own disappointments and his feelings for Jessica go beyond friendship though it doesn't appear that he realizes that until it's too late.  I cried for him more than once while reading this storyBOUND BY THE PAST is the second book in Ms. McKade's TIES THAT BIND series. BOUND FOR THE HOLIDAYS was the first book . . .  and now I'm praying that we'll see at least one more story to add to this series.  Clancey deserves his own story and I have to tell you if there's a man out there who deserves a happily-ever-after then Clancey's your guy!Beautifully written Ms. McKade.  This is definitely a story I'll be adding to my keeper shelf.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",5,1
"I think the writer will improve in time, but she rushed to publish.It is apparent, due to the massive typos and long-winded paragraphs.There is action, full force, nearly each sentence.The story is all over the place and fails to make any type of plotline stick out in the reader's mind.In short, this book has potential, but it simply wasn't ready for publication.Yes, there is a girl in a love triangle, but that is so over-done.The attempt at creating a fantasy world was the best thing this author had going for the story.There were all types of creatures, interacting and causing drama, but the main Heroine Rae~just couldn't fill the necessary duties as Protagonist for me.Again, I do believe this writer will improve in time.

"When books have cuss words in them, it really upsets me.  I go ahead and read them to see what the stories are about, but I don't see what the author gets by using them.Spoiler alert: There is a rape, on stage at a bar for people to watch and do nothing about.  An Austrailian policeman gets beat up and no one does anything about that.  The F word is everywhere, and that is just the first four chapters.  I quit reading then. I do not understand why the author thought he had to use the word all the time to get his point across.Also, the errors in writting are a bit much.Sorry, but I can only give this book 1 star. I am so glad that this was a free book.",1,0
"Sydney Somer's Primal Hunger is one of those stories that disappoint me, not for what it is, but for what it could be and yet isn't. Full of interesting mythos, a spunky heroine with a backbone, and an Alpha male to drool for, the building blocks exist to make this title a really fantastic paranormal romance. Unfortunately, the combination of the length of the story (far closer to novella than mass market paperback) and the focus on the sexual relationship between the two main characters, Kennedy and Tristan, kept this book from truly blossoming into a fully satisfying read for me. And that's a shame, because there really was a lot to like about Somer's writing style and creativity here.Ultimately, there just wasn't enough story to raise my appreciation for the book higher than three stars. I'm a huge fan of erotic fiction. I actually prefer my books with healthy, adult, explicit sex scenes that help define and enhance the romantic pairing between couples in paranormal romances, and I'm very open minded about sex in general. Flowery euphemisms and delicate wording are a turnoff - in life and in books. That being said, however, my preference is that the story comes first and the sex scenes be a part of that story, not the whole of the story. In Primal Hunger, the sex (while steamy, hot, and very erotic) was the center of the story and the plot and mythos about the gargoyles, wraiths, Avalon, King Arthur, Fae, as well as the development of the emotional side of Kennedy and Tristan's relationship, were more like random leaves being tossed around in the cyclone of the sexual relationship. That was such a shame, because I love gargoyles and wish there were more paranormal romances that featured them, and Arthurian novels have always been an interest of mine. By the end, I basically enjoyed Primal Hunger for what it is, but felt disappointed by all the missed opportunities to raise the bar. Still, I've got the  second in the Pendragon Gargoyles series, Primal Attraction, so I'll be giving the series at least one more go.",3,1
This was a fun read! The characters left me wanting more which is always a good sign. There was a good amount of sexual tension which I think is part of this book's charm. Believable characters who stuck to their traits. Well written with a good plot!,3,1
"Nice for a quick read.  Interesting...written by the doctor that treated Lincoln after the shooting until his death and what he did to keep him alive as long as he could, from his mortal wound.  As a nurse, it was interesting to me to read of the medical procedures done back then.  Things have changed so much.  I enjoyed the read.",5,1
"Really enjoyable book. I read it for the story not to edit the typos, I don't notice little things like that if I like the book. I could have used less of the intimate sections and more of the conflict between creator and fledgling. I was teary reading the reunion of family members. It gets an A from me.",4,1
I loved the author's writing style and her story-telling talent!  This is a great satire on current media and laws and the author has blended them with great characters and passion.

"I had no idea this book was so short and that's because I forgot to look. The bottom line is that there really want much of a story and the entire thing was sex between two friends who both secretly wanted more.

"Not a bad book, but too long and drawn-out. The character development of some characters was fabulous while others not so much. It was a very odd mix. I did like the story and the writing. The author has definitely got some talent, but I felt it could use a little red pen love from an editor.The character I most enjoyed was Kelly, but I thought she kind of became minimized towards the end, whereas I really expected to her to have a larger part in the ending.If you like Stephen King and have a Kindle, grab this one, it's not all that expensive and is a good read.",3,1
"I enjoyed the storyline but it left too many questions unanswered for me to give it a good rating.  The reason I didn't give it a better rating was because the story could have been much better if the author concentrated on answering the questions about his wife and best friend's murders.  The story while enjoyable did not follow what the plot started off as but instead dwelled too much on the antics of Nicky. Jared wants revenge against Ricard so when he finds out the true story, the reader is then left with a big &#34;Why&#34; was she killed in the first place.in a way, I think the author forgot what her plot really was.  She had too many sub-plots instead of developing the main plot which was the murder revenge.",3,1

This is a VERY short read but still quite fun.  One serial killer likes to pick up hitchhikers and kill them.... another likes hitchhiking and killing the people that pick her up..... you get the idea from there.  Nothing super new as far as ideas but still a lot of fun to read.,3,1
Whoever wrote the synopsis of the story did not read it.  She wasn't trying to drive him away with sweetness.  She really was sweet.  Though apparently not to sweet to casually give away her virginity.  But give her credit she is smart enough not to mention it to him and get away with it.  No real point to telling him.  I know some readers felt that she should have remained a virgin because of the time period.  But unfortunately girls have been talked out of it by the wrong guy throughout history.  Nothing new on that front.  Anyway still a pretty good story.,4,1
Did not like this to much the story line was only about sex needed more substance to catch my attention,3,1
A little ho hum.  Joanna is a great heroine who really needs a break.  Aiden is her break.  He is a super nice guy but the I can never love again because I buried my heart with my first wife has been done to death.  He comes from a dream family with the exception of one brother who i assume will crop up in another book.  They're all kindness and light.  The good people from the church however are all mean and backstabbing.  Could someone explain to me why in all these Christian books the church goers are gossipy hags who have fun hurting peoples feelings.  Anyway it is nicely written and has some real charm going for it.  But don't expect originality.,3,1
"I thought it's a crime thriller. When &#34;elves&#34; were mentioned, I thought it's a metaphor. But it turned out to be a supernatural novel with elves and a beast.There are some loose ends the author didn't answer. For instance, Izzy suspected someone was helping George to get in the building. Nothing was mentioned about it afterwards.Some plots are hard to believe. Why did the police not take the case seriously? How did George and his car hide in a small village where almost everybody knew everybody else?",2,0
"This is the story of events surrounding one ""Telly"" Tellis, an aging, alcoholic, divorced with one alienated child and a granddaughter he has never seen political reporter for The Harrisburg Herald whose mother lives with him.  Telly is pretty much a mess of a person when he attends a political rally and a fellow reporter is shot.  The original theory is that the shooter was attempting to assassinate the Jr. Senator from Pennsylvania.  This turns out to be a false assumption and Telly is smack dab in the middle of an investigation of a serial killer and is forced to look into his past of which he is not very proud.  Add a possible love interest in Cassie Jordan who worked with Telly but now is the national reporter for the New York Times and John Luciew begins to weave a very good story.There were times when I could have sworn I had read this book before, but couldn't find that it had been printed in a real book form.  If I haven't read it before, there are parts that are most similar to another book(s) I've read.This is a book which holds your interest and keeps you turning the pages.  Putting it down is possible, but not for long.  The characters are believable and likable but not necessarily would you want them to be your best friends.All in all, it is a good read. Considering the Kindle price; it is a great read.",4,1
"The premise of this book was interesting, cloning Jesus Christ.  The story the author wrote was an interesting one, but needed help in transitioning from one sub story to the next.  The reader was left wondering how two different stories intersected.  And just when you thought you understood what was happening, another sub plot was introduced.  While I enjoyed the book, I have to admit that it was one of the most difficult to follow",3,1
"even it was free, it was not worth it.  the hero was too arrogent.  the heroine was spineless.  all over the book she ranted about independence and love. the hero said he loved her but he was letting her wed another man.  her father made him kidnap her.  i could not get into the story.",1,0
"I must have missed the free version I paid .99 for mine, and I so wished I bought the extended version. I will be buying it after writing this review. I love the idea and I used something similar in the novel I'm currently writing, but with a different end result. He had me hooked when he picked up the kid at the Cracker Barrel. I use to work there and it was less than an enjoyable experience. I'm thinking, does anyone hitchhike anymore? I saw a young man on the highway doing just that the other day. They probably never read this story. I love the idea of a woman serial killer, and as a writer, I often wonder how a woman could pull it off. Brilliant, I loved it. I see you have a lot of negative reviews - you must be doing something right. Serial is not for the faint of heart, but if you love horror, and I do, you'll be pulled into this story and wish it never ended.",5,1
"Indian Moon had a lot of great things going for it; this made the abrupt and unsatisfactory ending especially disappointing for me. Quinton was a great character and I loved the way that he found his way back to his Native American roots and that helped him face his present-day issues. Regina was a very complex character; she still has a little bit of self-worth left and it was struggling to emerge under Quinton's attentions. Wayne was a perfect example of how total power leads to total corruption; he is thoroughly evil. Quinton's great-aunt, Whispering Feather (I loved that name!) was marvelously wise and had a very generous spirit that reached out to encompass Regina as well as Quinton. And let's not forget Quinton's dog, Hurricane and Regina's dog, Fury; they had wonderful personalities, as well.This was a very well-written book although the proofreading could have been done better. The imagery was really wonderful; the graphic descriptions really made the people and events come alive for me. I just wish there had been an epilogue so I wouldn't have been left not knowing what happened to anyone.********spoiler alert******** I was very angry that Regina blamed herself for not fighting back sooner, especially when it was clear that the only reason she was able to prevail against Wayne's violence was because of the two dogs protecting her. I worked with battered women and the most likely time for a woman to be killed is when she confronts her abuser. At the very least, she would have been severely beaten.I still got a lot of pleasure out of reading Indian Moon even with its faults, so I would recommend it to others.",3,1
"As much as I love fantasy, I don't read a lot of that genre nowadays, since it's so hard to separate the wheat from the chaff, with so many authors trying to be the next Tolkien or Rowling. Nevertheless, I had seen some favorable comments about ""Sage: Tales from a Magical Kingdom,"" and I noticed that it was a short book, so I downloaded it for my Kindle.It's a nice concept. The author, Maria E. Schneider, has created a mythical magical kingdom and introduced the reader to this realm through three short stories featuring the main characters. In a different twist, instead of having a world inhabited by ordinary people with a scattering of wizards, witches, and the like, in Sage, everyone is a magician of sorts, with each person specializing in a certain form of magic. The first character we're introduced to is Demetria, an aging grandmother who is a Master Gardener, having the ability to communicate with and influence plants. Demetria's husband, Ward, is a Stone Master, who has the power to manipulate stones (which comes in very handy in one of the stories).In the first of the three stories, ""Toil Trouble and Rot,"" Demetria discovers that the kingdom's crops are rotting due to a magic fungus introduced by Sage's arch enemies, the Rats who live just beyond Sage's borders. Demetria and Ward, with their children, Gavin and Xylia, set off to determine the extent of the damage and to destroy the fungus. With help from their friends, each of whom has a special magical power, they go in harm's way to battle the fungus, which is as deadly to humans as it is to plants.""Dungeons and Decay,"" the second story, is about a search for Demetria and Ward's son Gavin, who is missing and is feared to have been captured by the Rats in the kingdom of Ratdom. In ""Call to Arms,"" the third story, Demetria and Ward and their friends are involved in some nastiness by creepy crawlers from the Slithering Kingdom.Sage is a magical kingdom, but the magic is white magic, or earth magic, where the human inhabitants are finely attuned to their natural surroundings and can subtly influence and communicate with objects like trees and stones and animals. There are no wizards hurling lightning bolts or casting evil spells in Sage, which was a relief from the typical fantasy story. In that sense, Sage is reminiscent of an earlier time in history when people were more aware of the natural world and their surroundings. Demetria, Ward, and the others in Sage are interesting characters and certainly sympathetic ones as they go about protecting their land from the dangerous, evil creatures who surround them.Ms. Schneider's writing is very polished and professional, and I found no spelling or grammar errors. Also, the Kindle formatting was perfect. I take neither of these for granted, and the author obviously took a great deal of care in editing, the bane of many authors today.I'm not sure what kind of reading audience ""Sage"" is targeted toward, but in my opinion, it's suitable for children through adults. There are some scenes that might frighten a very young child, but any kid who made it through Harry Potter would certainly be okay with ""Sage.""My only negative comment - and it's a very minor one - is that there are only three stories in the book. The magical realm that Ms. Schneider has created certainly invites more stories, possibly even a full-length novel about Sage and its people and their relationships with other lands and people beyond its borders.In the fantasy genre, it's getting harder and harder to find new books that are both original and well written. Maria Schneider has written a winner with ""Sage.""",5,1
"Destiny is a sensible kind of woman and when her grandmother tells her she is destined to meet her soul-mate she shrugs it off as silly nonsense.  However when she meets Reece the sexual chemistry between them is undeniable.  They quickly escalate their new friendship to a physical relationship and in doing so they make a connection on a completely different level, one that frightens them both and leaves Destiny to wonder if soul-mates really do exist.Eden Bradley knows how to heat up the pages in a hurry.  She creates sexual tension and love scenes that will get your heart racing.  But she also creates characters that are realistic and fun to read.  If you're looking for a quick, sexy read to warm you up, then Winter Solstice is just the ticket.  I enjoyed Ms. Bradley's style and look forward to more in this series as well as her other titles.",4,1
I absolutly love this author.  I bought the book because I thought I could depend on her writing to carry the book even if it was a short book.  I was wrong.  The book starts out on a good note but by the end you just want it to be over.  The characters although well written have no real depth and the female seems to be an air head with not backbone.  This book is defininetly something I would not recommend you spending your money on.,2,0
This is a great book. I enjoyed the characters and the story line.  It was a good read and didn't require a lot of thought.,5,1
"I read this book all the way through hoping it would get better.  For me personally it never happened.  While I love a good Vampire story I never could really figure out the gist of this one.  There was so much left hanging that it didn't make sense to me.  Yes I love a good cliff hanger story as much as the next person, but give me something to want to come back to read the next installment.  Again for me this didn't happen.  I've ignored all the grammatical errors in this book, as sometimes that happens when you convert paper to digital, and graded it on it's appeal to me. Someone else may come along an think it's the best thing around.  YOu'll have to decide for yourself if you choose to read it.",3,1
"I enjoyed this book. Hope there is a second book to follow soon. About a young woman in her teens overcoming her fears and being bullied in her school. With her friends and family overcoming the bullies, temptations of the world and focusing on her singing and her family and close friends. I would approve this book for anyone over the age of 12. I'm 60.",5,1
"So much of this is so dated, it's not worth reading. I read a bit of it when I was much younger (not yet a teenager), and there may be a good reason it is largely ignored.History is good, but often it's only historians of a literature who care.",2,0
"This is a greatest-hits grab bag of 25 stories from the Grimm's Fairy Tales collection, unillustrated, and apparently taken from the 1884 Margaret Hunt translation.

"I DID mange to finish The Home, but it was such a slog for me. I think it was only my stubborness that kept me reading, the feeling you get when you're in a competition of some sort and you want to quit but you tell yourself that you're going to make it to the end no matter what. The characters were fine - although her hero was too fixated on Clint Eastwood for me - and the underlying premise was interesting, but I just found it painfully slow and the ending was unsatisfying to me. Many people liked it more than I, so I hope that if you try it, your experience is closer to theirs than to mine.",2,0
A very fine book chock full of ideas and action. I liked the characters and the twists and turns. If anything there was a bit too much detail about some aspects of the Longclaws world. But overall it was quite an enjoyable read.,5,1
"Blush* Here I go againNot sure why I read this one - I'm curious - I don't know much about this type of stuff - so why not (plus it got good reviews and highly recommended for a good ""smutty"" read) And Yes it was :)I'm more surprised that I'm giving it 5 stars - Not something I usually do - but this e-book really had me in full blush more then a few timesThe story starts off with the great 4 best friends attending a marriage of their good friend with his... 2 new wives - ok sure why not :) These girls seem to have fun together as well as with him, so it worked out ok for them.Once they got the ""I do"" ""I do"" I Three"" out of the way, Lee threw his brides over both his shoulders and headed down the beach to the cruise ship that was going to take them and their closest friends for a cruise they'll never forget.Charli is a tomboy - she always has been and always will be - her 3 best friends , Raf, Simon, and Eric are practically glued at the hip. They have been best friends since they were kids - growing up, Charli's parents died, and she moved in with her 3 best friend's and their crazy Aunt Kelly.Getting older in age, Charli realizes that the inventable is going to happen. Someone else is going to meet their match - after all, these guys are georgous - it wouldn't be long right - then she's going to be alone, and she's not happy about that.She thinks of these guys as more then just best friends - but of course, she would never let THEM know that :)On the cruise, they land in New Mexico - where the ship board people have put together a kind of Race - something simluar to ""The Amazing Race"" I supose - so when Charli arrives at the bar too meet up with her friends for the big race, she is surprised that they had left already. The director of the game found her and hurried her into the cab with another couple that was late, and drove them to the rest of the players.Only there is a catch - this is not ""the amazing race"" that will take them all over the beautiful city - no no no, that would be a different type of story - this one, this race was the Erotic Race - BWAHAHAHAH!I was stunned - threw of me off - it wasn't anything that I was excpecting. I knew it was an Erotica e-book - but it still wasn't what I thought it would be.Oh to see these 4 people reviel their true feelings was just Awesome!Defiantly a must read for those that enjoy sexy, steamy, hot romance books - especailly with more then one sexy, steamy, hot guy :)",5,1

"Taken is basically a short story from Anya Bast, the book overall is written very well and has a very unique twist on soulmates and three-some's.Anne has worked her way up to be the youngest partner in her law firm, since she was a child she hasn't had anyy family and yet she was determined to make it in the world. But now the only thing she has is her job, no love life or family/friends. While she went to go get her morning cup of coffee from a local cafe she gets chased my a Frankenstein looking thing and runs for her life. When it seems like the thing is gaining on her a handsome man pulls her aside and then her world goes black.Van and Caleb are from another world, literally not figuratively, and they have come to claim their mate. On their world a war has been going on for centuries and women who can produce children are few and far between so destiny has given them the same mate to share. Now all they have to do is protect her from their enemies and convince her that she belongs with both of them on their planet.Taken is a unique story with some pretty hot-n-sexy scenes but follows with a romance and a war between the races.ash",4,1
Great series so far. The second book is as wonderful as the first. The caricatures are wonderfully funny and endearing. Definitely worth the read. These books are short but you really get to know the caricatures.,5,1

I loved this book and I cannot wait to be able to get the rest of The Gray Court series. It was full of action and very hot. At parts I laughed so hard. This was the first book I have ever read by this author but let me tell you it will not be the last.,5,1
"This is the 3rd book from this author I have read. I keep wanting to find a reason for the good ratings, but I just cannot see it. Take this story for example:Our heroine unknowingly uses magic to call an angel to seek vengeance on her cheating ex (no details are ever given of this). Hmmm, angel seeks revenge on a cheating ex boyfriend. Seems below his pay grade and petty on her end. But that isn't what is bad about this story. After this nothing really happens in this story at all. They make the ex jealous in a strip club and fall in love. Filled some pages with mediocre sex. The End. Now, I enjoy a good erotic story, but this is not even good erotica. There is no conflict in this authors stories and no conflict results in a very boring story.I hate to leave really bad reviews, but I wish someone else had left an honest review before I bought every one of her kindle ebooks based on all the ""glowing"" reviews I read. If you are looking for a story with any action, then look elsewhere.",1,0
Enjoyed the story but extremely short for the price.  Would have felt justified spending the money if it was at least 20 pages longer.,4,1

"This was a fun read. Really cute story, nice HEA ending. I guess it didn't rate higher because it was less steamy than I had hoped. I mean sure, they had a bit of fun, I just wasn't mentally invested in either of the main characters. I'm hoping the second book is better.",3,1
"From the description of this book I was really excited to read it (especially because it is(/was) a free kindle download). I was expecting to really become lost in this story as I have with other post-apocalyptic (kind of...) stories, but unfortunately it just wasn't a must-read for me. Until I got my kindle and started reading free kindle downloads I wouldn't really have considered not reading a book all the way to the end, but book got very close to being deleted before the end. The thing was, every time I started feeling like I just didn't want to read any more something would happen that would draw me back in enough to keep me reading. In the end I actually did get some level of enjoyment out of reading this book because by the end I was unhappy that there wasn't more of it to read. A good part of this was probably because of the questions that were left unanswered.The story is about a group of elitist people in a city who decide to start their own invitation only city....by building it directly on top of the city that's already there. The author doesn't do a great job of describing exactly how this works though (stilts? support columns? what???), and doesn't explain at all how what is going on with this city relates to what is happening in other places around the world. Is this the only city like this or are there more?I could have gotten over all the left out logistical details about the city seeing as the book was free and I eventually found myself mildly entertained, but the character of Malcolm would have been better left out. Adding Malcolm into this story added a sci-fi element that just did not mesh at all with the rest of the story. He felt like some throw-away character that came out of no-where just so the author could claim he'd done some sci-fi work.",3,1
Once you are used to the time and period of these stories they become quite interesting and hold thereaders attention.,4,1
"It is too short to have any character depth. 2 sex scenes, one in public. This is one shifter book I wished I hadn't bothered with. If you like smut, you'll like this.Basically the guy kidnaps the girl, they have sex, under duress on her part. He issues commands, there is no compromise. It's either do it his way or she will be forced( put on transparent cloths, get out of the bath, etc). There is no emotional relationship. None. But at the end of the story, she tells him she loves him, so that makes everything good. Right?",2,0
"Okay, I'm officially hooked. The Granite Lake Wolves actually had me at the end of Wolf Signs, but this book just reinforced my opinion.I liked Tad when he was introduced in the first book, but we really only got a quick glimpse of him. Readers found out he was a loving, over protective older brother, but that's pretty much all we got. Tad was oh so much more than that.Missy was desperate, but knew more about wolves and how things worked within packs than Tad. She felt the connection between her and Tad, but she was blinded at first by the need to escape and protect her sister. She didn't intend to find her true mate, but having it be the person she had always felt most comfortable with was perfect.Tad's sense of honor was both admirable and frustrating. He was adorable in his shyness and I loved the way he was with the rest of the pack and his sister. The relationships between all of them just keep growing stronger and I felt just as strong a connection with Robyn and Keil as I did in Wolf Signs. I like it when a series moves on, yet doesn't abandon previous characters entirely.The next book in the series is Wolf Games and it features Erik. The family connections haven't ended yet, because the female in this one is Missy's sister, Maggie. After that, we finally get to spend some quality time with TJ... that's one that I can't wait for. *sigh* Between Books 2 and 3, Vivian Arend has treated us to two novellas that are super short, but super hot. They're only 10 pages each, so I probably won't review them separately. First Howl features Robyn and Keil and Second Howl features Tad and Missy. They are worth a download though because what they lack in length, they more than make up for in heat. Just don't read them before you finish Wolf Flight.",4,1
The only good part of putting this book on my Kindle is that I did it when it was free. I was looking for quick fun things to make to EAT in the microwave and instead found a book suggesting things I consider DANGEROUS to the continued good health of my microwave.

Well I only downloaded it to read what is was about. But to be frank my not even my 5 year old sister found this  enjoyable . No offence it's just my  opinion but  this book needs to get a lot of upgrades to the 24th century before getting any good reviews.,1,0

"I LOVE BELLE ANDRE!!!!  Let me start by saying that I truly truly enjoy reading Belle Andre books.  Yet this one fell short.  Usually I can sit down with my pot of coffee on a Saturday and Sunday morning soaking up the romance that drips from the pages and by Sunday evening, I'm sorry that I read it so fast and want more. The story just didn't make sense to me.  I had a really hard to time getting into the characters.  It was steamy but usually Belle Andre has me with the love story and the steam is the bonus.

"Hailey Jennison was uncomfortable with her body, and had always been shy because of it.  She had developed early, and had to constantly deal with unwanted attention from men.  She didn't go out very often, but did enjoy getting together with her friends on Friday nights.  They had recently become obsessed with a neighbor that provided an exciting sideshow for them.  He is a construction worker named Gage Warren with an incredibly sculpted body he didn't mind showing them frequently.  One night when Gage caught them looking in his windows, they scattered, but not fast enough because before she knew it Hailey had been dragged to his apartment.  He had been attracted to Hailey from the first moment he saw her, and now that he saw his chance, he was going to take it.After they had been together a couple of weeks, Hailey finally told him what he had known all along.  She was afraid he would leave if they didn't have sex, and equated it to her dad leaving her when she was just a small child.  Gage couldn't believe she didn't get it.  He was completely in love with her, and now he just had to get her to believe it.  There was no way he would let her get away.Gage and Hailey are a fun couple.  Hailey has a lot of issues to work out, but Gage loves her and is willing to wait as long as it takes so they can be together forever.  His family is also priceless.  Most people have meddlesome family members, but the fact that two of his work in the mental health field, make the dynamics even more comical since they feel compelled to constantly give advice.",4,1

"Judith Ivie has had a twenty-five plus career writing and editing. As a Connecticut native, she sets her latest Kate Lawrence mystery in Hartford and Wethersfield. She has an eager audience on the East Coast. A SKELETON IN THE CLOSET is her third Kate Lawrence mystery, and she has published three non-fiction books.Kate Lawrence is undergoing several lifestyle changes at once: her long-time love, Armando, is moving in with her; her daughter is stretching her wings and has a new boyfriend; and her son is incommunicado with new exploits. To add to this, a telephone call from a couple of elderly spinsters who live in a grand old historic mansion reveals an actual skeleton in a closet that has been bricked up for forty some years. Kate is in the real estate business with a couple of lively women partners, and they rush over to be of assistance to the confused little old ladies. But by the time Kate rushes to their aid, the body has disappeared:""A pile of old bricks, mortar, splintered wood and other debris attested to the recent demolition of a narrow section of wall at the back of a closet next to a huge, ancient furnace. The new opening revealed a narrow space. John's flashlight shone on the pipes leading to the ancient boiler, one of which was leaking visibly. On the floor at the rear of the closet next to the pipes lay something that looked like a rag along with more bits of mortar and brick. I thought the cloth was dark blue, but I couldn't be certain. Except for some shelving filled with books and files along the back wall of the closet-like space, it was empty. I blinked and looked again. No body, no bones, nothing.""A SKELETON IN THE CLOSET is a delightful cozy mystery, New England style. One can almost imagine Kate Lawrence as a younger version of Jessica Fletcher. Her fiery romance with the elegant Armando contributes romance, and her friends and fellow realtors provide glamour and humor. Kate is undergoing a midlife crisis of sorts, which actually grounds her and provides the reader with a glimpse of a middle-aged adventurer. The police appear at appropriate intervals, and life issues pop up to make this a densely packed little read that is both light and entertaining.Shelley GlodowskiSenior Reviewer",5,1
"A secret combined with political power equals a man held in an asylum with no reason to be there.

"This is Jules Verne's classic tale of undersea adventure, as best I can tell based on the 1873 translation by Lewis Mercier. Since that's been the standard English translation for over a hundred years, it's probably the one you remember reading way back when, and the edition you'll be familiar with.Re-reading this as an adult, and an adult who's spent twenty-plus years since then reading science fiction, I did have to remind myself more than once how amazing the then-future technologies Verne describes, like electric rifles, undersea diving suits, electric motors, etc., would have been to his contemporary readers; the book was first published in 1869, a mere five years after the Confederate submarine Hunley became the first submarine to sink an enemy warship (and sank itself in the process).  At times I found myself mentally substituting ""outer space"" for ""under sea,"" just to help me analogize the situation. Despite that,  the plot and action were as riveting now as they were when I first read it twenty years ago. I did find myself, now as then, skimming over much of Verne's extensive scientific descriptions of undersea flora and fauna, etc., but that might be my own failing as a reader -- when I did take the time to read Verne's descriptions, I did sometimes catch the same sense of aquatic wonder I remember from watching films like _The Life Aquatic_.From what I've read, the Mercier translation this is based on contains a number of translation errors, cuts out about 20% of the text, etc. Corrected, completed, updated ebook editions of this classic are available on Amazon, but they cost money -- I've been unable to find an out-of-copyright, corrected, complete, and free edition. For readers on a budget, though, this is probably the version you remember, and if read in the right way -- keeping in mind the era in which it was written, and skimming whenever the science gets too dry or detailed for you -- it's still quite entertaining.Verne did write a sequel, _The Mysterious Island_, also available in the kindle free store; the better translation is available here:The Mysterious Island.",4,1

Not a book I would recommend to the more discerning reader. I actually deleted it before I finished reading it as it was rather a smutty book. CV Gibson,1,0
"This was a nice mystery to settle down with and read.  It did a good job of drawing me into the story.  I liked the setting, although I know nothing about Maine, and the characters were very likable.  I plan to read the next in the series, 'Murder in the Choir Room'.",4,1

If you have visited Ford's Theatre or the house where Lincoln died across the street from the theatre then you have imagined the scenes described in this account by the people who really were there. It is not a long account but it is a must read if you love the history of our Capitol city and are a &#34;Lincolnophile&#34; .,4,1

"This story sounded good to me. I eagerly downloaded it for free. Now I've finally finished, I'm glad I didn't pay anything for it.I was pulled in at the start, thinking this might turn out to be a 4 star book. The writing style took a little getting used to. Much of it seemed old-fashioned, but since the story started out in 1924, I was willing to go with that. The basic premise of unrequited love, a marriage of convenience, and an ambitious young man battling the odds kept me reading. Initially, the author did a fairly good job with an omniscient POV, which is generally difficult to pull off. Though this tended to keep all the characters distant, and I never felt much of a connection to any of them.And there are A LOT of them. This is not a book to put down and take up again next day. I tried this, and found I had lost track of who was who. But it's too long a book to read in one sitting, so I resigned myself to jotting notes. Ug.The heavy used of the passive voice made many scenes pass by as if it were all happening behind a scrim, or out of focus.Eventually, I came to the conclusion that the negatives in this book outweighed the positives.Positive: I wanted to find out what happened to the families.Negatives: Most of the characters are completely unsympathetic. The few I came to like had something horrible happen to them. Almost everyone is just mean and vindictive to each other. I kept waiting for good to win out, but it never does. There is nothing satisfying about the abrupt and ambiguous ending. I was left with the feeling that I slogged through all that nastiness of human nature with nothing at all to feel good about. Oh, and after years of loathing and contempt, turns out that was really just magnetic attraction in disguise? Yay, another dysfunctional partnership in the making. Wonderful.Remember that omniscient POV I mentioned? Well, it dissolved into distracting head-hopping. I'm pretty sure this story could have been told effectively without knowing the thoughts of every person in the scene, always.Often, the author was not content to show us fits of rage, but then felt the need to tell us the character was enraged. Yeah, I got that.Overall, I have to say the author didn't have quite the skills to manage this bakery. The writing was amateurish in many places. This confection--a dry doughnut with just a smidgen of cream filling to entice--ended up giving me indigestion.",2,0

"Make Mine Midnight is a novella that takes a twist on the high school wallflower/high school sweethearts tale.While there are plenty of hot scenes, there are also just as many eye-rolling moments.  The writing isn't stellar, the story has more fluff than meat on its bones, and in fact many lines/sentiments are repeated by the two male characters, Mason and Hunter.  There is also quite a bit of unnecessary contradiction, with not enough explanation - the best friends are completely straight, yet they always date the same women? Uh... huh?This is a quick/fun holiday read, but certainly won't be winning any RITA awards.",3,1
"RUBY TUESDAY by Mari Carr.STORY BRIEF:Teagan plays guitar and sings folk songs in her family's Irish pub.  She likes writing music and performs one of her original songs.  Sky is a rock star, traveling incognito, trying to avoid the paparazzi.  He came to town for a few weeks for some quiet time to write music.  He happens to be in the pub when Teagan performs.  He likes her song and asks her to be a cowriter, working with him to write some songs.  At first she refuses, but then agrees after losing a bet to him about music knowledge.  They spend a lot of time together.  They are sexually attracted to each other.  She is a virgin and wants to wait until she falls in love before having sex.  He respects that, so they play with each other sexually without taking her virginity.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I wasn't surprised or delighted with anything.  The characters, dialogue, and plot were ordinary, nothing new.  It wasn't bad.  I kept reading out of curiosity, but I wasn't drawn in.  Although he is protecting her virginity, he gets into some kinky sexual things right away which was odd.  He ties her hands, spanks her, uses a toy, and includes rear door activity.DATA:Reading time: 2  hours.  Kindle count story length: 2665 (262 KB).  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.  Sexual language: strong.  Number of sex scenes: 8.  Setting: current day Baltimore, Maryland, and a cabin in Virginia.  Copyright: 2009.  Genre: erotic contemporary romance.",3,1
"I didn't exactly like this book but I didn't hate it either. It is very long without any real story going on. The Character's aren't consistent and neither is the plot. Here are my problems with it:1. Jasmine (the heroine) she starts off seeming strong and independent. Then becomes immature at times and even submissive and sometimes flaky. Then she's back to acting strong again. She keeps flip-flopping from one way of thinking and acting to another.2. Keilan (her love interest) starts off seeming concerned about scaring her and not wanting to harm her in the beginning. He then turns into a dominating molester within the next chapter or so. He again becomes a sweet romantic love interest halfway in the book then dominating again. It's very confusing who these people are and what they are about. There were many other characters mentioned but you barely know them or understand where they are coming from either.3.The genre didn't seem to fit what was actually in the book. Yes there is some romance, there is fantasy/sci fi but there is also erotica in the book. I wish the author picked a genre and just went with it instead of tried to blend so many in one. She goes into descriptions of each in different scenes but the tone and feel of each scene doesn't always feel like the same book. Primarily the sexual aspects seemed really obscured compared to the rest of the book. I wish she would of just chose Full erotic novel OR Full romantic novel. Neither aspects seemed to blend together or stayed consistent in this book. Also the sexual aspects were so few and far between in the first half of the book that it seemed out of place.4. OK so the book is about a girl with Charmer abilities (can seduce shifter men with her scent basically) who happens to be best friends with a shifter princess. Why should we, as the reader, care about this and what does it have to do with the story itself? I'm not sure about that answer. Again if this was a full erotic novel some of the sexual themes and her seductive powers would make more sense. Like the sexy clothing and underwear in the beginning, is suddenly forgotten after the first &#34;molesting scene&#34; then she's able to wear dresses and regular shirts and pants. What was the point of that?? And a scene where an aphrodisiac was used then backfired to cause a loss of sex drive just didn't fit in. But since this is a romantic/action/fantasy I think?? I'm not sure why we should care or where the author was taking us with all this. Or why so many things were mention just to be resolved and forgotten about within a page or so later.So in a nutshell, there were things about it I liked. Things I didn't like and things that just didn't make sense to me. There were a lot of scenes and characters that could have been cut from this book to give it a more focused feel and shorten it. I hope the author chooses to rework this one and give it  more structure. She had a lot of cool ideas and interesting world she created but I feel her story needs more planing. I will not be following the series but I enjoyed most of the journey in this book.",2,0
"If you've come down this far in the reviews, then I hope you'll finish reading.  I hope you'll also note the publisher's review that implies very mild BDSM and lots and lots of sex.  Don't download this book if you're gonna have a problem with sex on a first date, explicit sexual language and graphic descriptions of sex or people having, you know, sex.To call this a PNR is a stretch because it's way too erotic to be a romance.  And apparently it's not erotic enough to be called erotica for some picky people.  If the rest of the story is only a conveyance to get the couple in bed, in my mind that's erotica even if it's tame.Okay, so now if you're still interested, please get this book!  You won't be disappointed.  This is a straightforward story with a very simple plot.  It's not superior storytelling; I would have liked more character development on both sides, and the dialogue is not great.  But, ultimately, I read erotica so I can get jazzed up and go jump my husband; this book definitely, erm, scored in that regard.  I hate contrived drama between the male and female who could clear everything up if they only talked about their feelings or asked the right question.  The couple in this story had a problem and voila, they talked about it so they could move on to the good part.  What a concept.So, yes, the sex, there's a lot of it.  Just because nobody gets a ball gag in their mouth doesn't mean it's not hot.  The couple connected, had chemistry and the scene where she's doing the monster, holy smoke... well done.",4,1
"Another well written story by Julie Miller. I really enjoyed reading it. Jack and Alex have a 15 year age difference between them but I like stories like these. I find the age difference to be kind of sweet. I only felt that the beginning was a little hard to accept.Unless I'm mistaken about his duty time, I would have liked for Jack and Alex to have met as they did while Jack was not on duty. He really knew nothing about her and for him to get this intimate with her in this type of situation didn't seem like an honorable decision. She really could have turned out to be much younger than she had told him she was. It also didn't work because immediately after being assaulted by one man she just met, she got intimate with another man she just met. Some of their scenes take place in car but it was a little confusing exactly how they were positioned. Also, just a small pet peeve of mine of littering, one of the characters just simply opens the window and dumps ""something"" right onto the street and he was a cop.Once you get past their initial meeting, the story is good with a good amount of suspense and romance!",5,1
"And I do mean WHOA!  This started off great and went downhill fast after the party.  One thing I really can't stand is when a man calls the woman he is suppose to care about derogatory names (bitch, slut, and whore).  What was worst was when he had her to call herself those names.  Of course the female was a strong woman with a submissive side, but this went to far IMO.  It really reminded me of today's younger generation where the male teen calls the female bitch and she answers.  Victor was cold, mean,and abusive and when he thought the welts were beautiful from his caning...she should have told him take a picture bc it won't be happening again and the same with the hot wax.  It came across to me as though he was learning the lifestyle, bc he would forget to take care of her.  She was attracted to him and wanted someone to dominate her sexually and he just wanted someone to abuse.  Victor made out like a bandit in this one and I couldn't picture this relationship getting better.",2,0
"It's hard for me to say exactly how I felt about this book. Would I recommend it? Maybe to my dad or grandparents. The book was solid and the mystery plot decent, but I felt overwhelmed by info dump and mundane aspects. I found myself just wanting to be through the book so I could be done with it and start another. Yet at the same time I wouldn't say the book was 'bad'. There were parts which held my interest and honestly I was surprised how things turned out. But the description of every meal, every movement around a kitchen to make said meal left me...skimming for the meat of the book. If you are forty/fifty and under, I think you'll find the book slow/dull. If you are late 50's- 60+ or need to pick a present for that age range - this would make a good gift.",3,1

"I love Grace Livingston Hill's books. They're sweet innocent love stories with good morals and likable characters. Keep in mind though, that this story takes place in pre-civil war New York state and that the story was written in the early 1900's. A side-plot involves the hero becoming an abolitionist which puts him at odds with his pro-slavery uncle. The views expressed by the characters are far from politically correct and one evil character uses the &#34;N&#34; word. Just beware. That aside, the story is about sweet, orphaned Phoebe fighting against being married off to an oaf while she makes friends with the handsome, upstanding hero....the fun is that Miranda (from the first book in the trilogy) is able to provide just the right help at the right time and everyone can tell how it ends of course....!",4,1
"This is one of the worst cookbooks I have read in a long time.  There is no active table of contents,  which would be bad enough.

Overall,  just not a very good book.",2,0
Love this series currently reading book 3 and i love this one. Give this series a try you wont be disappointed.,4,1
Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this book but do wonder if the author was told she couldn't go over a certain word limit.I liked the characters and the book was well set up to be an interesting novel.  But instead I got a novella where the conflict lasted a single confrontation between the two main characters and the attempted murder mystery lasted all of a phone call from the hero to the sexy security guy.If either of these events had been stretched to encompass a chapter or two the book would have been so much better.  The players were in place but the game never happened and the reader was deprived of what could have been a really good book and instead got some really good sex scenes.If you'd like an hour or so of entertainment buy this book.  If you want a good romantic suspense buy something else.,3,1

"I was expecting to like this book, but just not my cup of tea.  I quit reading after the first two chapters because I was plain bored.  It may be a good story, but he went into such detail about firing up the hibachi and what he was cooking on it that I was flipping through pages waiting for something more.  Perhaps if I had gone farther into the book it may have been better;  but if a book does not grab me in the beginning, I don't waste my time.  There are far too many really good books to read in this world than one that does not interest me, although others may find this book just what they like.  Diversity is what makes the world go 'round.  Am glad I got it free, nothing wasted but my time.",2,0

Extreme fairytale. I'm a grow woman who grew out of fairytales decades ago. If you love syrupy books this is the one for you. The bdsm which only came in at the very end and only after they were married was sugary sweet and not at all what I consider bdsm.,2,0
"Yawn, I felt the story should have been longer. giving the reader more of an opportunity to get to know Alexander Moretti and his motivation for becoming a thief other than his desire to please his father. I felt that his love interest Celeste Anderson was kinda weak. She really had no back bone. She seemed desperate, like she didn't feel secure in her own skin. She had no self confidence what-so-ever. And to have her just fall into bed with Alex upon meeting him was totally unrealistic. She didn't know anything about him. He could have been an Axe Murderer for all she knew. The premise was good, but the plot was kind of weak. I wished the author would had more character development then what she gave us. Not worth the download. No wonder it was free.",2,0
"Ok the main character in this book was meant to be a super genies right?? Well for someone who is meant to be smart she was very, very stupid!!!! And the plot was terrible, who marries someone after knowing them one day, she is meant to be scared for her life and she just somehow automatically knows he's a good guy..... after he tells her that he lied about who he is and that he has had people watching her and has done a background check ( I would be pretty pissed if someone told me that) all in all this book was pretty bad it had some funny parts in it but the jokes were repetitive i wouldnt read this book again",1,0
"Nice story. Nice characters. The problem is that too much of the story is told passively.

Better works of hers includes Joe's Wife and Land of Dreams.",3,1
"I'm only reviewing this book, more accurately a story, to counter the overly positive ones it has received.  Otherwise I wouldn't even go to the trouble. I bought this because the plot seemed interesting--ancient vampire who has been disturbed by a young woman buying and moving in the old farmhouse over his lair.  It had promise--promise that the author couldn't fulfill.The book was written as if the author had a formula to write by: Introduce main characters, immediately have them have dream sex, then have male lead tell her that she is his one, and BTW he's a vampire and then have sex for the rest of the story.  No building up of the plot or tension between characters which lead to any type of climax (non-sexual type) and resolution.  The only vaguely dramatic scene happens off the pages--we see right before and after.  At least I know not to buy any more of her books.",1,0
"Another one that I picked up as a Kindle freebie.James is one of the chief doctors in the emergency room at a London hospital, with a strict rule of never mixing his personal life with his work one. Until late one night a massive car accident brings an unexpected but familiar patient, his ex-wife Lorna, into the E.R. Lorna, also a doctor, but a small town GP looking for a change, was in London applying for a hospital position. With no close friends or family in the city, and in no shape to make a long journey back to Scotland James takes Lorna into his home and personally takes over her care.Soon James and Lorna find themselves questioning the painful reasons that their brief marriage ended ten years prior. Will bringing up the old tragedy and hurt that strained their relationship to it's breaking point allow them to finally have closure, or will it bring them even closer?I really enjoyed this book. It was very sweet and thoughtful. I really liked all of the characters and felt that the author presented them in a way in which the read could commiserate with both parties.This book is very emotional, but for Lorna, the heroine, it was mostly internal meaning she refused to talk to the hero about issues that were essentially keeping them apart. This is really the only problem I had with the story, because it prolonged the outcome of the book, making it longer than necessary.",4,1
"I was not really into anything paranormal before reading this book. This one completely changed my mind about this genre. I was hooked from the very beginning of this book although I thought it was going to be a story about a ghost approaching someone outside, in a place such as a cemetery. I could not put it down once I started it. I love that I could not predict what was going to happen next. When I read books, I like to be surprised by what happens next (in real life, I hate surprises) and this one definitely kept me moving to the next page to see what surprises were in store. Part of it was also very suspenseful and I loved the way the story ended but I wish it did not have to end there. I enjoyed reading it too much for it to come to an end. I will be sure to read it again. I will be sure to read more of this author's books. I did purchase this from Amazon but I don't see the Amazon verified purchase button.",5,1

"Candy Girl is the first book I've read by author Eve Vaughn. This book is a novella so it was a quick read. Julie Bennett is tired of being everyone's pushover. Her co-workers gave her the nickname, Candy Girl, because she keeps a candy dish on her desk. Gabe, Julie's boss, has lusted after her since day one. And he hates how the co-workers take advantage of Julie's kindness and generosity. Gabe is there for her when Julie is betrayed by her boyfriend and cousin. He's there for her and sees it as the perfect opportunity to explore his attraction and feelings for her.I enjoyed the book a lot. I felt sorry for Julie. She's the nice girl who can't tell people no. I saw Gabe as Prince Charming, saving the girl from her wicked step-mother. In this case, her mean co-workers. The attraction and chemistry between Julie and Gabe was believable and hot. This is another book featuring an interracial couple (BW/WM) but while reading the book, race is not an issue.

I liked that the book showed the emotion and the honest liking and friendship between the two men...not just the lust and physical desires. They were so much a part of each others lives I could understand how Mav could overlook his real feelings for Duke. I liked that though they each had confusion and conflict in the relationship there were no outside influence in the form of other potential lovers. They dealt with their problems one on one and Mav wasn't so stubborn that he refused to reconsider his position on the relationship to the point that the friendship was destroyed. The ending was very satisfying. They discovered that the unknown is often more frightening than the reality. A truly great read.,5,1

"I'm giving this bundle an over-all 4 stars because it's a fairly good read and the bundle deal was too good to pass up for the price.  If I had bought the books seperately at a standard price I might be inclined to give them 3.5 stars if it was available.Over all the story line in these books was pretty good.  The third book was a bit of a departure from the first two with a whole different plot line going on but it was still well worth the read.The books have an interesting array of characters with completely different cultural and physical aspects which I found interesting.  The story is mostly limited to the city of Elantra with some areas, or fiefs, technically in the city but ruled by other various outcasts or fief lords that even the king wouldn't bother trying to dislodge. We also get hints that these fief lords in fact serve a purpose to protect certain old magic in those areas. I would like to see further development of some stories that include characters from other fiefs besides Nightshade and maybe inclusion or further development of stories based on the old magic contained in some of those fiefs.Some of the main characters, while not overly complex, caught my interest (Nightshade, Sanabalis) and I hope we get more of them in the future.  The emperor we hear about and I assume we'll meet him the future.Unfortunately the main character of the book, Kaylin, just comes across as developmentally disabled.  She's been with the Hawks (a law enforcement group) since she was a child and was basically raised around them.  Although, she admits she failed every class given unless it was, by her definition, practical (IE: weapons, fighting, law, Barrani Language), how could she not pick up many of the cultural or political terms and situations just by being around the people.  She continually asks stupid questions that any normal person raised in that atmosphere would know.  Of course everyone just looks at her like she's retarded and refuses to answer her questions... so she's stupid and you just keep her stupid.  It basically came down to an overdone character type of her being the ""bruised and abused good hearted innocent hero, that basically saves the day by luck.""Apart from that I got sort of tired of hearing about her being broke, needing food, and hating magic and refusing to learn because it's not useful to her... yeah magic would neeeeveeer help you out of a tight situation when you're in danger. LOLI'll keep reading in the future, just because I really do like the overall world and character building and I hope at some point Kaylin evolves a bit and actually realizes she had to learn to use whatever powers or skills she has and stops being a bumbling savior.",4,1
"It was okay but since it was neither of their faults that they were separated, the story was redundant. They said the same things over and over again. Plus, she says the dress she was wearing at one point was perfect for the summer day it was but it was set at Christmas time. Ms. Darcy needs a better editor. It also bugs me that the hero had been with other women but since he thought he was betrayed, I am not as upset by that then I would be if they were just apart for other reasons. I still like my couples to stay faithful to one another during their separations. He also told her he thought of her when he was with other women because they never made him feel what he felt with her. Ummm... is that supposed to be sweet??? It is not!!",3,1
not well-written... no plot. characters cliched. and the whole fat/chubby thing could have been SO well written... and bad descriptives just made the issue icky instead of luscious and REAL. save your money...,2,0
"The first three of these books fit together wonderfully as the opening trilogy of the John Carter of Mars series.  For pure fantasy adventure, few books have topped these.  The other two are somewhat lesser works but still very enjoyable.If  you are interested in Sword and Planet fiction for the kindle ebook, you should also check out the Alan Burt Akers series, which are direct descendents of Burroughs.  Transit to Scorpio is the first in that series.I would also recommend my own Talera series, which includes Swords of Talera, Wings Over Talera, and Witch of Talera. They are also available as ebooks. I see a lot of folks brag on their own books but I am proud of these books, and if you look at the reviews under the paperback versions you'll see that others enjoy them as well and consider them excellent modern continuations of the Sword and Planet tradition.",5,1

"It's hard to believe that this long, tedious, silly tale of Egyptian wizardry was written by the same man who wrote ""King Solomon's Mines.""

"I did enjoy this book but it's definitely more about the sex marathons between Lena and Luke than ""the plot"" that could kill them as Luke tries to save his people. The writing was decent and I did like the character of Luke but the story could still use some work. This edition could still use some editing and the author has the annoying tendency of constantly identifying the characters rather than switching to he or she after the first few times. It pulled me out of the story occasionally but it's not a major issue. The sex does tend to go on for a while but there are some definitely hot moments. The whole scene with Luke in his ""monster"" form was pretty ridiculous but it didn't ruin the entire book for me. I got a little confused with all the characters thrown into this story (obviously to set up future books in the series) with 5 best friends including Lena plus Luke and his 2 buddies I couldn't really keep up with who's who when they all got together. There's a small bit of action in the story but Luke's quest to make this movie doesn't actually happen in this story, I'm sure it's going to be prolonged over the course of the series so be warned this is definitely a story about Lena and Luke's relationship or sex life really than anything else. I feel the author missed an opportunity to expand on the life and world of the monsters but overall I liked it for what it was and it's definitely good if your just looking for a little steamy bit of escapist fluff.",4,1
"&#34;The Letter Sweater&#34; is set in, NC, always one of my favorite settings, especially when it includes the ocean, beaches and coastal scenery.  The characters are somewhat realistic, the story woven around a long lost love that is found in New Bern, NC after a 30 year span.  I enjoyed reading the story for a light, breezy read and was impressed by Mr. Crayton's tribute to the love of his life, his wife Jane, who passed away a few years ago.",3,1
"I thought this book would be totally different.  With that said I will tell you that I am a romance nut.  I felt this book was way too sad and ended to abruptly.  If it would have continued with her meeting a man who swept her off her feet and brought her back to life...so to speak... then I would have LOVED the book.  However, it just ended with her thinking that she could start over again.  UGH... to sad and too short for me.  :(",2,0
"Having also grown up in the backwoods (Mississippi), I enjoy reading about the lives of others in the same predicament.  It isn't polished, more a book written for the family.

"I haven' read every one of the books, but I intend to over time...Why? Because as much as I love the old fashioned and complex writing style which is SO detailed; it is quite tiring to focus on so many more words than most modern authors would use to describe a dream, a room, a road, a beloved face and so forth...Still very worth reading and great for one's vocabulary",4,1

"Contained in this Jennifer Cruise bundle:Getting Rid Of Bradley- 1.5 StarsLucy Savage just got divorced. Her newly ex-husband didn't even bother showing up for the final signing. Her controlling, though well-intentioned, sister is ready to remove body parts off the man, but Lucy is feeling more confused than heartbroken. She wants answers for why her husband was making time with a blond bimbo in their house. Over lunch, she tries to explain to her sister that she's okay but ready to take control over her own life...as soon as she gets answers from Bradley for why he did what he did.Across the restaurant, two cops working on an embezzlement case overhear Lucy talking about Bradley and officer Zack Warren realizes that the tip he and his partner got to show up at this dive to nab Bradley the embezzler just went live. He confronts Lucy as she's leaving the restaurant...and then bullets are flying and he's getting beat up by the woman who's life he just saved.Lucy feels nothing but empowered as she realizes she's successfully defended herself against a mugging and takes off after the police show up to grab the wretched scruffy guy in leather who put his hands on her. She feels so empowered, in fact, she decides to dye her hair. Blond was a mistake, so she tries for brunette. Just as she's realizing that the attempted dye job left her hair dead and...well...green...the doorbell rings and the thug she'd beat up is standing there...with his policeman's shield in hand. Oops.Today Lucy got divorced, shot at, manhandled, dyed her hair green, and beat up a cop. She isn't having a good day.What started out as a sort of loony but amusing premise was quickly strained by an anorexic plot that pushed beyond the boundaries of plausibility or credulity and by characters that lacked more than superficial development. Zack is the Peter Pan who equates committed relationships with death and Lucy is the pushover who is so intent on remaking herself she's willfully blind to common sense.Though I prefer more three dimensional characters and found Zack's abrupt about-face on relationships as soon as he spends time with Lucy a bit hard to swallow, I honestly liked him. He's pretty uncomplicated and generally a nice guy - and any male who still wants a woman with ugly green hair is worth something. His character and his reaction to things is where all the humor in this book lays for me. I didn't find him believable, and he's pretty two dimensional, but I did generally enjoy him.What really turned me off this book was Lucy. I found her character to be so irredeemable - between her lack of common sense and worse, lack of intelligence, her absurdly obtuse reactions even after things started blowing up, and her apparent lack of self preservation, I couldn't figure out for the life of me how Zack could even tolerate her, let alone love her. I actually found her distasteful as a character and difficult to read when paired with Zack.Unfortunately, for a book like this to work for me, I have to like both leads. I so disliked Lucy that what would have been a silly and unrealistic but entertaining light romantic comedy, Getting Rid of Bradley, was ruined for me.Strange Bedpersons- 3 StarsOriginally published in 1994, there's little about this quirky romance about the ladder-climbing yuppie Republican lawyer Nick and the hippie, commune-raised, militant-feminist liberal Tess that doesn't feel almost painfully dated. That being said, Crusie pens a fast-paced plot that delves more deeply than I'd anticipated into the potential disaster of a relationship between two people who love each other, but who are so different they will never see eye to eye.Nick, despite his career-loving little heart, is a fun character who is actually pretty forgiving and able to compromise, though he does have a rather vanilla predilection for sex in bed. He's pretty darn forgiving of some pretty radical behavior and recognizes before Tess does that some compromise is in order, yet he still manages to mess up a little as he presses his own sense of fashion off onto the bohemian Tess and tries to wear down some of her rougher edges before he realizes that he's got to decide to accept her as is or lose her. I found Tess harder to like, though I did respect her commitment to her values. Still, her uncompromising attitude and selfish judgments of those who don't share her militant views were off-putting through most of the book.Strange Bedpersons started abruptly, too abruptly, with Nick banging on Tess' door and Tess closing it in his face, the two of them obviously already sharing a history. It took a little while to get the story on their history, so the opening of the book seemed jarring and left me feeling like I missed something. It made it hard to get into and I had to struggle a bit to 'catch up.' That did subside a bit as the story progressed, though the other issues - the dated feeling and my issues with Tess - didn't. Still, I can't argue Crusie's ability to nail witty, fast-moving dialogue and touch on human truisms with humor and intelligence. I just wish that prior to republication, this story had gone through a bit of a brush up to make it more socially and culturally timely and not quite so anachronistic to contemporary romance.What the Lady Wants- 4 StarsMitchell Peatwick Kincaid is a stockbroker, but a fondness for Sam Spade and a mild feeling of discontent with his job convinced him to get a private investigator license, and about a year ago, a bet with his boss and some friends - and a lot of alcohol - goaded him into leaving his prosperous career with his prestigious firm, putting the stuff from his monied life into storage, and taking on private detecting as a career under the name Mitchell Peatwick. And if he can get his private investigation firm into the black in a year, he'll win that $10,000 bet.Twelve months of private investigating, however, taught Mitch two things: everybody lies, and real life private investigation work doesn't resemble anything remotely similar to Sam Spade's life. Until SHE walked in.SHE is Mae Belle Sullivan and she's looking for a PI who isn't all that bright so she can lie to him. Not for kicks, but to get help finding answers following the death of her uncle. Answers that will save Mae from financial ruin and explain what her reprehensible old fart of a relative was doing with all the art and keepsakes that have been disappearing from his house for the past few months. An overheard conversation pointed her in the direction of her uncle's journal, but it's been missing since he died and Mae's starting to get frantic to find it. So she lies. And she uses her feminine wiles. And she pays Mitch Peatwick just about everything in her bank account to investigate the murder of her uncle. Who was in his seventies, had a heart condition and a twenty-five year old mistress, and died in her bed. Mae's fairly certain it wasn't murder.Mitch knows he's being lied to by the delicious-looking Mae Belle, but her retainer pushes him into the black and secures his bet...and anything is better than trailing cheating spouses, so he takes her case. There are just a couple of problems for them both. Mitch isn't anywhere near as slow as Mae had hoped, and as more and more clues start to pile up, her uncle's death starts to look more and more like an actual murder - even to Mae.With a quirky cast of primary and secondary characters and a twisting, rollicking plot that includes suspense, mystery, romance, and comedy, What the Lady Wants delivers a lot of charm and a few good hours of light entertainment. Originally published in 1995, the story is a little worn around the edges and has a bit of a dated patina to it, but not so much that it detracts from the story as in some of Crusie's books. It's more like a faint scent on the air than a bat upside the head. Noticeable, but not painful.Mitch is a fun character, and quicker than he looks. Which is probably a good thing. I'm dating myself here, but he reminded me a lot of Magnum PI or Rick Simon from Simon & Simon - a bit cynical about life, a bit sloppy on the outside but sharp and thorough when he needed to be. Mae was endearing. Intelligent and kind, with a streak of independence a mile wide and a determination that is formidable. She's a bit stubborn when she needs to be, but not so cold as to be unappealing as a person. She cares about the people she loves and takes on the responsibility of caring for them, as needed. Together they made a good couple, and their banter was one of the high points of the book.Crusie excels at quickly paced plots with quirky characters and a lot of witty, intelligent, and sarcastic banter. It's what keeps me coming back to her when I want or need some brain candy. I'd love to see this story get a bit of a modernized polish to clear away the dated patina, but even as it stands, I liked it quite a bit.Charlie All Night- 3.5 StarsWhen you're the go-to girl at the radio station and you're producing the number one drive time show in the area, you've got a lot of responsibility and your future is looking bright. When the talent of that show dumps you, then two months later fires you from the show, you're bright future starts to look more like flames from a crash and burn. Allie McGuffey is feeling the heat from those flames after her radio personality ex-boyfriend Mark dumps her as producer and the station puts her on a new overnight time slot. Pushed from drive time to overnight is humiliating. Pushed there by her ex-boyfriend with his supercilious attitude and delusions of competency is even worse.Putting on a good face just leads to another crisis as a mad dash to the nearest bar/restaurant with her ex hot on her heels forces Allie into uncharted waters. She picks up the first non-suit wearing male she can find and desperately tries to act like she's perfectly okay while her insides are still quaking. Though the rugged man she clings to is obviously surprised by her blatant come on, he doesn't sell her out, which makes him a hero in Allie's book.Charlie Tenniel is a bit of a bounce around. He doesn't stay in one place too long, doesn't limit himself to doing one thing for his life, either. His wanderlust is a constant disappointment for his socially formidable father. His brother, radio personality Ten Tenniel, was more the man his father wanted him to be, but look where that got him - a drug habit and escape from prosecution courtesy of their father's connections. Charlie wasn't going to go out like that. He was, however, going to take the job his father wanted him to take as a favor to the station owner, an old family friend. An anonymous tip claims knowledge of a drug ring opperating from the station and Charlie's been conscripted to chase down the responsible party. He just wants to fly under the radar for the six weeks or so he plans to stay in town, so having Allie pressed up against him is just fine, but when he realizes she's his new producer and intends to make him a star, he's just as adamant that she doesn't.His position would probably be a lot stronger if he could just stay out of her bed.While the premise of Charlie All Night is a bit of a stretch and the actions of Allie and Charlie seem more than a little irresponsible both sexually and professionally, I can't argue that the story itself is light, fun entertainment with plenty of endearing moments. I enjoyed the banter and romantic development between Allie and Charlie. Crusie does banter and endearing really well and it's definitely in evidence here. There's not much to the plot, though, and with an original publication date of 1996, there's a dated feel to both the technology and equipment described in the station and a definite pre-Monica Lewinsky air of sexual permissiveness in the work place that didn't translate well for me.So long as you don't take the book too seriously, or expect much in the way of depth of plot or character, there's still a lot of entertainment to be had from the story of Charlie and Allie, two people who won't be poster children for sexual harassment litigation any time soon, but who still managed to make me chuckle.Originally reviewed by title for One Good Book Deserves Another.",3,1
"******SPOILER ALERT*******This is my second HKW book after ""Hell Bent"".  I understand ""The Chosen Soul"" was HKW's first book written some 10 years ago, and that it was revised by the author after reading some of the reviews.  Well, I think it might have needed a second revision.First off, let me say the author writes very well in general.  She also is highly imaginative and her action/battle scenes are exciting. As I'm still fairly new to the Fantasy Genre, it did take me a few chapters to immerse myself in the world setting.  As in ""Hell Bent"" I felt the situations were reasonably complex and the characters numerous.  It took me a while to sort everything and everyone out.  In fact, by the 40% mark (no page numbers on Kindle) I found myself growing confused about the three male love interests, mixing them up to such an extent that I had to go back to re-establish their identities.  They were all wonderfully handsome, had numerous magical powers, hypnotic eyes and all of them fell heavily for Raven/Winter.  That became a problem for me as the story progressed.  I got a little tired of all the handsome men wanting her so badly.The next problem for me was our heroine, Raven/Winter, herself.  She was kinda wimpy right up to the very end of the book.  I'm sure that finding out your father is a devil would be a shock, as would realizing you have demonic powers of your own.  But when your life, or those of your loved ones are threatened repeatedly (and I do mean, repeatedly, as in everyone is out to kidnap or rape you over and over again), then own those powers and use them to save yourself, woman!  Can't just stand on those exceptional good looks.Full points for the many great plot twists.  However, at one crucial point about 60-70% along, I must have been distracted and missed an important point.....that Cruor was Gray Beard!  Boy, I felt dumb over that one when I had to go back a few chapters to sort it out.  It threw me off that the character was called by both names later on in the narrative.On the whole, the plot was a little disjointed, but the individual plot ideas & inventions were interesting and imaginative.  I liked some of the characters a lot, like Loki and Abonides.  I found the names a little bit difficult at first but got used to it by the end.Perhaps, ultimately a bit dark in tone, and I do agree with other reviewers that the novel ended abruptly, like ""time to wrap this up now and finish up in a sequel some day"".  Raven/Winter didn't win points by resigning herself to life with the Elven Prince, but I guess she was just being practical since Drake was gone.  She was probably tired after fighting off all her abductors and needed a good rest.I will be reading the author's other books as I bought them all, they were such a good price.  But I do hope they will be a more satisfying read than ""The Chosen Soul"" was.June 9, 2011 - Edited typos.",2,0
Very FAST! It was good and I felt bad that she had to go through that alone because he gave her a false name. I do like how their feelings never changed even though she is more cautious because of how he left and never got in touch. I do think he was faithful to her based on how he says his personal life suffered majorly because he was a workaholic and how every moment that he had away from work was filled with thinking of her. She was faithful to him because she had a son and never dated. I like when the hero and heroine only wants the other especially in this book because they both knew they had a once in a lifetime spark with the other. It was cute and fun and I was happy that he took the blame for them being apart and did not try to give blame to her for keeping his son from him like so many other heroes do even if the heroine did not know his real name.,4,1

"Toni Blake is one of my favorite authors; great stories, well developed, likable characters, with some good sizzling sex scenes- they have always been a hit with me. This story is about Aunt Millie from ""Letters to a Secret Lover"" it was very short, 35 pages, a cute, sweet read. It reminded me of the Grease era, Johnny with his ducktail hairdo and leather jacket- very reminiscent of Danny, Millie- the sheltered, virginal Sandy. The story is about how they meet and fall in love. Since it is so short, there wasn't much detail and over development, but it still worked- a good love at first sight story that takes 30 minutes to read.",4,1

"I just can't drag my rating any higher than a 2 star here. I acknowledge that despite my love of dragons and erotica I might not have been the best reader for this book. This is one of those books in which everyone is always spouting off wonderful affirmations and bad things never really happen. Despite the storyline, it's like being stuck in a church van full of kumbaya -singing mormons who only want to help you see how wonderful you really are. The feel-good factor starts to chafe after a while.I think there is a plot that encompasses the whole series (of which there are now 7 books and 3 novellas). It's obvious that war is brewing, royal progeny are going to spring up somewhere, ect. However, there didn't really seemed to be a single plot contained within this book itself, other than lots and lots of sex. Unfortunately I didn't even think all that sex was particularly hot. It lacked details and a lot of it was same-same (for example H1 and H2 never even changed positions).Plus everything moves exceedingly fast. Insta-lust isn't even fast enough to describe it. Within the course of one brief conversation the h and H1 met, fell in love and dispensed with her virginity. Within two days he has asked her to marry him, introduced a third party (H2) to the mix and convinced her to be comfortable with all the other voyeuristic knights. Within a day of that she's rolling with the double penetration, draconic aphrodisiacs and apparently learned to have multiple orgasms a the drop of a freakin' hat with little to no for-play. I know this is erotica. I know I have to suspend my disbelief. I know it's fantasy and all in good fun. But seriously, I could not make myself believe anything could move so quickly.I did like H1 and H2 (H2 probably most of all). I like the mother and Jarred. I liked the dragons. I liked the interesting Wyre life...sorry Lair life. The idea of two men per woman is an interesting one, though male pairing would seem easier. (I don't think I'm the first review to point either aspect out.) I didn't care for the h though. The h, I might point out, who isn't even important enough to have her own name in the book's description, so you can imagine how much effect she has in the book. No, despite liking many of the disparate part of the book I didn't like the book as a whole. Others do. I can't say I cared much for it.",2,0
"Claire is holding down her usual seat in a corner during a New Year Eve's party, people watching and making notes for the erotic romances she writes. She notices a really hot guy who causes her to have very exciting fantasies. When she realizes that he and another hot guy are coming her way, she looks around to see who they are coming over to see because it cannot be her!Former geeks in high school, Mason and Hunter are at the party just to see if the Claire they are hearing about from Mason's associate Paul, is the same Claire they went to high school with and she is!

Hot & Fun Read!Once again Mandy Roth has me smiling from ear to ear with her talented and creative writing. This second installment in the Talon's series is so cute as we find out why Sachin holds so many secrets that even his King doesn't know about.  The story kept me glued to the pages and I could clearly visualize every scene as it produced such excitement from the drama foretold.The characters Sachin and Paige were perfect for each other and had me smiling and laughing at their playfulness.  The erotic scenes were absolutely thrilling getting me all excited with arousal as I read the in public (Side of building in Town) sex scene between Sachin and Paige - so freakn' HOT.Sachin and Paige's HEA was perfect and had me laughing in the end as this strong tough guy (Sachin) faints when Paige goes into Labor and then faints again when just mentioning his daughters growing up to date.  LOL  This was truly a cute story.You know this is an awesome read when I am craving for more in the end.  This is one series I highly recommend for your hungry minds sexual quick fix and your need for exciting drama.AWESOME READ!,4,1
"I had forgotten how much I enjoyed reading books by Grace Livingston Hill. I read this one first and it stood alone very well. I read the first book next, and am now reading the third in the series. The reader does have to &#34;self edit&#34; a bit due to the fact that the book was scanned with many resulting errors in transcription.Hiram was a villain who was easy to hate, as were Phoebe's jealous sister-in-law and niece. Phoebe was easy to love. She was incredibly strong when faced with much travail.I am giving the book 5 stars in spite of the transcription errors. It is that good. Besides, I need to get back to &#34;Miranda&#34;, the 3rd book in this trilogy. I highly recommend all Grace Livingston Hill books.",5,1

"I admit, I picked up this book for 2 reasons. #1 I like reading time-travel books to see what other people feel is important to change. #2 I wanted to see what the author did to Babe Ruth, who is a (few times removed or whatever) cousin of mine. (It was fine, and I laughed a few times when he hit the nail on the head about GHR.)I admit freely that I am a person to whom covers are important, and I think this cover fits with the 1919 themey feel of the whole story.Suspension of disbelief is a little necessary during the building of the time machine.. I don't care how much of a genius someone is, Radio Shack is not the be-all/end-all of electronic components. If the author had just said something like, {He started scouring websites to find the parts needed} I think it would have been more believable.As to the story itself once the two men are in the past, I really enjoyed it. I liked how their ""planning"" wasn't quite perfect all of the time, and they would have to come up with new parts to their plans or change the plans a bit to cover unknown situations. Reality is you can't perfectly plan every situation, and it's nice to see that reflected in a story.",4,1

"Damn. I bought this after really enjoying the Spark series.Big mistake.I stopped after the first escape attempt was followed by the first episode of sexual degradation.Writing like this perpetuates and reinforces the notion  that women like to be kidnapped  and raped.What answer would you get from the latest escapees in Cleveland, among so many other unfortunate women who have been kidnapped into sex slavery?You should be ashamed of yourself, Ms Dawn - especially as you can write much, much better than to use this cheapest of cheap tricks for so-called ""romance"".I won't buy any more of your books.",1,0

As Quinn McKay find himself in the verge of loosing his wife for his stubbornness he is forced to reevaluate his life and his relationship. But it is Libby herself who lets him know that a woman has needs other than a good house and a steady income.When Quinn and Libby go back to basics it is here where they remember why they decided to get married and spend the rest of their lives together. Because they are explosive together and each have what the other needs.I like how in this story we get shown that no matter how long you know a person there is always something new to explore even if it's something old...,5,1

"I really enjoyed this book.  I thought it would be the standard -woman gets pregnant and the father has to convince her to marry but she keeps saying no.  This time I understood her reasoning.  Considering her past, it made perfect sense for Lilly to be cautious about giving in to her feelings and to trust and feel hope again. This one makes you think.  Everything is not always black and white.  Very good read.",4,1
"Rune witch, Noelle, and Chaos Pagan, Wynn, are definately hot for each other. The attraction and the sex are still ablaze after five years keeping the need for condoms all over the house high. Knowing the power of their sexual heat, Wynn brings home a book on sex magick that will allow the two of them to harness their sexual energy and use it to cast spells.Sounds great doesn't it?Sadly, the story isn't much longer than what I just wrote. It was a ten minute read. Definately a short story. Don't expect a novella. There just isn't enough there to justify my time or the two bucks. Heck, for five bucks I can have a three hundred page novel.So, maybe you are just in the mood for a good, sexy read. Not so much. Yep. They have sex. Most of the pages are rife with sex, but it is vanilla and frankly saying that it is 'hot sex' doesn't make it hot sex. Deets help. Maybe a little stamina? Maybe a little experimentation out of the box?? Heck we are talking pagans here right? Pagans that have been together for 5 years.More than anything I felt like it was an education on magic and casting. It seemed like there were more details about the casting of the spell than the act.I hate to give anything less than 3 stars.  This is a great idea. It just needs to be developed. I don't even think it is worth a free read on a blog. It just doesn't seem finished.",1,0
"For a cursory read of the Apocrypha, this is fine.  However, there were many errors in typing, words omitted or partially completed.  If I really wanted to study the Apocrypha, I would look for another edition.  It's advertised as illustrated, but it isn't.",3,1

"I liked it but I can say that this wasn't my favorite of the 4 books in this series but it was entertaining and worth reading.  As a reader some things I both liked and disliked.Traver's family honor and guilt drove the story. I thought there could have been other more appealing reasons that could have been more entertaining. Rusty being forced into a situation not of his making put a bit of a dampner on the story from the beginning for me. I became frustrated for him being stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to please everyone but himself.Leaving that subject behind some of the characters bothered me as well. I felt Deke became more insensitive and controlling toward Rusty and at times I wanted to stuff a sock in it. Maybe that is what Ms. Hestand wanted me to feel and if she did than it was accomplished.I kept feeling as if the author glossed over situations that could have been built upon making the story more spicy and entertaining. Examples: had she built on Jennifer's appearance and the situation that occured. It would have made for more substance had she built more drama around the character.  I wanted to see her pay and pay dearly for her manipulation.I liked the way  previous characters made steady appearances throughout all the series so a reader could keep up with the happenings of those characters. I liked the way Cal was portrayed as the family support system even though Deke took the helm.  Emma remained a strong female Matriarch and supportive character along with Sammy Jo making her appearances.  I got to know and like this family.All in all I was looking for more meat to the story but what I read was enjoyable and more than I could have ever done.  I can come up with the ideas but could never have made any attempt at putting it down on paper as Ms. Hestand has done. Bravo. Enjoy, the price was definately right.",4,1
"This book doesn't work on any level.If you buy erotica for the sex, it doesn't start until half way through, and there is no heat once it does. If you buy erotica for the romance (i.e., the characters) at all, then you will be even more disappointed. The female lead cries in EVERY scene, no joke. And her happily married friend, almost as often. Also, a woman who works two jobs to support her gambling alcoholic of father (unemployed for the last three years) and gives him cash is NOT to be praised (she ain't no quitter), but tagged as an ENABLER in big need of THERAPY. And I haven't even mentioned how bad the portrait of the Italian mobsters is . . .I barely slogged through this and will not be reading anything else by this author.",1,0
I ordered this book on my Kindle for free and I am so glad I did not pay one penny for it. At 11% in I just couldn't take it anymore. The main character is mostly having dialog with herself in her head. A very irritating read. Deleted from my library.,1,0
"I received a complimentary copy of this book for the purpose of review. The review is my honest opinion and I was not paid for this service.I liked the author's idea of creating a Comic Book of the Bible to get children and young adults interested in reading God's word. He chose some excellent portions of the Bible to portray, but did not tell enough of the stories to get the message across. While this book has wonderful illustrations to gain the reader's attention, I felt as though there were not enough illustrations to be deemed as a Comic Book or Graphic Novel. Unfortunately there were several misspelled words throughout the book which is a distraction. This book would do better with more illustration panels and more of a storyline. I felt that the author did not capture and keep the reader's attention.",2,0
Why does anal s*x have to be in or play a part of almost everything considered erotic.  I researched this book through reviews and the publisher's website.  I was so disappointed by this.  It is so hard to find great authors of this type of fiction.  I'm going to stick with Aliyah Burke and Zena Wynn.  You can create great erotic stories without anal s*x.  Because I don't want to waste my money on something I can't read.  I need a disclaimer or warning.  So I've decided to do what I wish someone had done for me.  Consider yourself warned.,1,0
"I enjoyed the book.I normally don't enjoy books written by male authors but this one was good.I really enjoyed Paul getting into the dating scene with all the crazy ladies.It was surprising that he fell in love with a blind woman, but it really worked in the story.And even him being blind for a few days worked wel in the story as well.*****SPOiLER*****I am not sure why Christina had to die, that was just a bit too much for me.But I did not spoil the book as a whole.",4,1

"I downloaded this book because I thought it sounded interesting and it fit my budget, free.  This is the most disappointed I have ever been with any book I have ever been with any book I downloaded on my kindle.  It is filled with inplausable events(really, two sixty year olds that barely talked in high school, have not seen each other in forty years get it on with in a couple of hours of meeting back up.  the police hot on the trail of a serial killer know the next victim and decide to eliminate the police protection to one cop.  I mean I am willing to suspend my disbelief in a lot of books, but there was just way too much the author asked me to do in this book.  character development was non existant.  the author works under the delusion telling me what they have done and what they are doing is character development.  We want to read what is not there and it takes a delicate hand, which the author lacks.i know this was free so i should not complain, but this is a reveiw andothers want to know if they should waste their time(thats for you bob who felt the need to respond in a rather pissy way)  and speaking of that I also read the dark carnival before this not knowing it was by the same author.  I wrote a review pretty much saying the same thing I did here.  I was the first one since september to reveiw that book.  THE NEXT DAY was checking to see if mine posted and there above my reveiw was a glowing review of the book that was pretty much a defensive response to my reveiw.  coencidence(sp), i think not.learn from reveiwers.  you have great ideas.  i do not think anyone is going to deny that fact.  work on making it more believable and your characters more than prototypes and you will really have something.",2,0

"First of all, this was a short story and I really am iffy about them, but reading the synopsis decided to give it a shot. Needless to say I was completely disappointed not only with the length of the story, but the lack of depth it held. It was just one big mindless plot of strange people, with crazy issues, and no real basis as to why or resolution about what happens with them or too them. The writing itself was good, the author has talent and honestly if this was an intro to his work, it was a bit of a letdown. I may see if there are some other full length novels by the Author, hopefully it will serve me better.",2,0
"If you've been reading the Supernatural Bonds series, then you're familiar with the ""cro-magnon"" attitude that is held by most of the dragons in this series.  Krill is more so than most.  He's an older dragon, the ""knock 'em over the head, drag 'em to the cave, never let 'em out again"" type.  He has definite ideas on how he's going to get his mate, handle her, and bring her back to his realm and never let her leave again.  He reminds me of the ""Grr-Arrgh"" monster that used to run across the end credits of the Buffy and Angel series.This book kept me constantly entertained because Krill just wasn't getting what he wanted at any time.  I was cracking up at his responses to the situations that kept happening.  I won't rehash the plot or the story, but I will tell you that you will like this book!",4,1
"... Well maybe not let down as much as disillusioned. I have read about open relationships in other books and have not had a big problem with it...not really my flavour but if it is set up right then it's fine. I think what threw me is it the book opens with Angelo and Cole having sex with Zach going, sure whatever you want. Now, I had just read their book, Angelo and Zach's and there was nothing in that book that sets up the relationship as moving in that direction... If anything it is the opposite. So, overall while I think the book was technically well done I am just feeling disappointed in their relationship now. I think that if the author had prepared the way in the first book it wound not have been so bad ,,but that didn't happen. so this whole open relationship, one sided by the way (Angelo only), just ended them in a sour note for me.",2,0
"Love of a Lifetime is an enjoyable time travel romance, with strong characters, vivid writing, and an interesting premise. I would have given it a five, but there were some editing errors (much fewer than many Kindle books). I also didn't care so much for the chase scenes. Other than that, I really enjoyed this one. It's full of laughs and emotional moments. I doubt you'd regret spending the $2.99. This is a better book than many that you'd find at your local bookstore.",4,1

"Only after reading OTHER reviews did I find the term ""erotica"" to describe this book, which is much kinder terminology than it deserves. It would be not only prudent but advisable for Amazon to indicate, somewhere in the title, this is not your typical romance book -- perhaps a ""XXX"" before or after the title. This type of material really needs to be in a category other than ""romance"". Describing it as ""erotica"" is very much a misnomer considering how poorly developed the characters are, how non-existent the story line is and how desperately the writer needs to expand her vocabulary. I wasn't looking for sexually explicit material and would have appreciated a clue of some kind. After downloading, I ended up in an area with no wi fi access so I proceeded to (attempt) to read the book. Compared to classic erotica, I would rate this at comic book level or less. Fortunately, I had some crossword puzzles with me. If I could return it, I would.",1,0
"It's a short story that's meant to be entertaining and HOTT and it is succeeds in being both. If you go into it looking for the next ""Great American Novel"" you will be disappointed but if your looking for something fun and characters that are ridiculously likable, you'll get what you pay for. It's a simple story that doesn't throw you for any curves or crazy adversity but for 90 something pages, what more could you ask for? It's worth the read, I wish there was a part 2 I would so read it. The characters are too fun and the sex scenes are the best verbal porn I have read in a minute.",5,1
"My only issue with this short is the fact that he is her ""patient"", the thought that a mental health professional gives into lust with her patient makes my stomach queasy.  Once I put that portion out of my mind, I could appreciate the erotic scenes.Ross inherited certain alien genes from an experiment between human and Laetez scientists performed on his father.  While the experiment enhanced his father, they caused hyper aggression and strength in Ross, which led him to a violent life of crime.  Thyme is a counselor at Bane prison which houses only prisoners like Ross, maladjusted offspring of the original experiment subjects.  Luckily with counseling and some drug therapy Ross has learned to control his behavior and is now being released.  As part of his release he has taken a job as a manager of a space station, where he will live alone for 3 years.  Meanwhile Thyme who had developed feelings for Ross, decided to try and meet Ross in the real world.  Since he has never seen her face or even heard her real voice during the counseling sessions she has to be inventive as to how they can meet on a one man station.  Then starts the passion.As stated in the beginning I have an issue with a doctor/patient relationship, especially one that has lasted for more than 4 years.  However, when I ignored that issue, I found the story to be well written.  The story line was plausible (in a sci fi setting) and the sex scenes produced that lovely little zing.  Even though this is mainly a piece of erotica it also contained an interesting universe and several non sex related scenes which were written quite well and helped develop the relationship between Ross and Thyme.If you like erotica, I can recommend this story.  FYI the language tends to the dirty talk type and it also contains mild anal play scenes.",4,1

"Second book in ""Dakota Heat Anthology"". Preceded byHer Dakota Men. Followed byDakota's Cowboys. Note thatDakota Heat, Volume 1appears to contain the first two of 4, in paperback.Plot:To save her brother from jail Samantha appeals to the owners of Dakota Ranch. Shayne and Jackson see something more in Sam, someone they want to protect, love and maybe even have a future with. With a little loving, respect and patience it might even be possible.Comments:- Contemporary Cowboy erotica with menage (threeway) sex.- 2273 kindle locations, 31739 words- Sex is m/f and m/f/m - very generous and loving, caring, gentle and all about her. No m/m. Aiming for a committed threesome.- While ""Dakota Ranch Crude"" is part of an anthology, it isn't a *series*. These books are in no way connected and can be happily read independently.Opinion:Although the suspense is a little wussy, the romance is very sweet and the sex terribly HOT. Shayne and Jackson are sexy Alpha-types, but not so overwhelming that they smother Sam. Sam has strength, character, and intelligence - when they order her around she listens, takes it on board and understands why they are making these demands. No one is demeaned or treated as a child. They all take an intelligent, thoughtful approach to their relationship and respect each other. It's Nice. And when they come together, it's Hot. An excellent book. Recommended.Aside:Although we have strongly Alpha men who like their woman to follow the rules they've put down for her ""safety"" and ""own good"", they are no where near as Dominant as the men of Brooke'sDesire, Oklahomaseries. If you are looking for that style of book, this anthology is not for you. There are no bdsm aspects, no Domestic Discipline on principle, and the menage relationships are private rather than a societal expectation. Rather we have a good set of menage novellas with strong romance, steamy erotica and mild suspense plots. But they aren't in Desire.-CR-",4,1
"4.5 StarsCatherine Cullen-Wellesley is devastated when her husbands forget their date to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary, thus also ruining the surprise she had for them. At least they still had their upcoming two week vacation to Jamaica where they would have some much needed time uninterrupted. When Logan and Rhys postpone that to jet off on a last minute business trip, Catherine has to face the facts that her marriage is in serious trouble. Desperate for some time to think, she decides to go on that vacation without (telling) them. When Logan and Rhys return home to find her gone, they realize they're on the verge of losing the woman they love. Not willing to let her go without a fight, they chase after her and spend the next two weeks trying to gain her forgiveness as well as her trust.This story was an emotional roller coaster ride fro beginning to end. At first it was easy to side with Catherine. She's felt neglected for a long time, more so since Logan and Rhys began building their company from the ground up. Then we get glimpses into the minds of Logan and Rhys, and it becomes apparent that they love Cat beyond measure. They're not bad, just oblivious. When they finally catch up with her, they don't waste any time trying to convince her she's still their number one priority. However actions speak louder than words, and act they do.Catherine accepts responsibility that she's partly to blame for the breakdown of their marriage because she never told them how she really felt whenever they put the company before her. I liked that Logan and Rhys acknowledged that they'd messed up. They didn't try to dictate her around or make her feel guilty. However, after we find out about their background and that their quest to be financially successful was as much for her as it was for them, it made Cat seem clingy, needy and selfish (but it could have been her pregnancy hormones adding fuel to the fire). Despite being on vacation with her, they still had a company to run, and they left without leaving instructions behind, so it really bothered me that she would tense up and get angry or fearful whenever they'd take a work call or work email. Before things get better, there's a misunderstanding and more drama for them to overcome. In the end I think they redeemed themselves by making compromises that seemed so simple. If only they had come to that conclusion sooner. Hindsight is 20/20 and I think their relationship only got stronger because of all the heartache.Though the love scenes were steamy, I found myself skimming them. They weren't bad, but I was just more invested in the characters and their personal growth as they tried to navigate the pitfalls of work and marriage. This was an excellent read.",4,1

It was so good I didn't want to stop.The writing, formatting, editing, etc. were terrific and what I have come to expect from Mr. Konrath's novels.The action was tightly written with no extraneous detail.Terrific from beginning to end.The Bad Stuff:None that I can think of.This isn't really a criticism, but I would have liked to have more background on Taylor and Donaldson (I'm bad with names, hope I got those right.).  I always like to know the 'why' behind a serial killer. But, that's just my personal preference. It definitely did not affect my enjoyment of this gruesome story.Overall:If you liked Serial at all, you will love this even more. It's not quite as gory, but there's a time and a place for everything. This novella hits the bull's eye for action/suspense fans who like a little blood and gore on the side.",5,1

Because of this, he decides to pay her a visit.His wife, Melicent, is taking care of her ailing mother and is shocked when her husband arrives out of the blue.  I can't say anymore to the plot without giving it away, but it was a lot of fun and some unexpected surprises popped up which had me laughing.  I thought there was the perfect blend between plot, characterization, and sex.  And to add, the sex wasn't like most of the sex scenes you see in books.  The author used some great creativity in this area.Definitely worth the price and the 5 star rating!",5,1
"The premise is a clever thought.  The characterizations are unpleasant caricatures. The ending is an abrupt unfunny, unclever 'joke'.  If you like Seinfeld (which I don't as they whined all the time and were unpleasant caricatures [except for the Soup Nazi, and the tall, gangly, crazy fella]), you might like this portrayal of a stupid, clueless, awkward guy and a greedy, self-centered, heartless gal, and a faceless yet ethical corporation.  I think the premise could be reworked into a much better story, as the author does have some talent - I think he's just learning and could be very good someday (he needs a good critical reader, like an editor).",2,0

"I really enjoyed reading the first book in the Badlands Series about Logan, Derick, Miranda, Clyde & Clarissa all of them are looking forward to meeting there mail-order bride and or there new husbands. The story starts out with Logan & Derrick waiting at the train station for their mail-order bride that they specifically picked named Miranda, now this is the seventh day and she still hasn't shown and neither one wants to go back to their ranch without her. Finally after about two hours of waiting the train whistle can be heard, the guys are anxiously awaiting when the train pulls up and several people get off and leave but no Miranda. So when the conductor gets off they ask him and he says, &#34;I don't know, but I'm in a hurry to fetch the sheriff because at the last bridge a young woman jumped off the train, while we were moving very fast. According to a young woman behind the conductor it was in fact Miranda who jumped. Just great now what are we supposed to do, we don't have a wife now! Clarissa felt bad for these two guys they were both very good looking but very different, one was dark haired and one was light haired she hoped her intended was as good looking as these two. While she was deep in thought the lawyer Jasper who brought her out for Clyde came around the bend, and said I'm sorry Clarissa your intended couldn't wait for you and he got married a couple of days ago, &#34;What am I supposed to do now&#34; I have no money and I can't go back to New York. Logan piped up, hey we don't have a bride either how about you spend the day with us and see if you would like to marry me. Jasper got all indignant and said &#34;no you don't want to get involved with these two they are looking for something different&#34;, Derick said be quite Jasper let the lady decide. In the mean time Derick moved in close to Clarissa and said if you marry Logan you get me as your husband as well, she looked up shocked, but thought about it and said okay I'll spend the day with you. So as they started to walk away, she said okay I'll marry you, so they stopped at the church and Logan married Clarissa and she became Mrs. Granger. Read this book because you will laugh, cry and cum a whole lot.

"I had not read a story of a survivor from Bialystok, Poland.  I had read previously read a story of a Rabbi from Bialystok, but he spent the war in Russia.  Therefore, this account was more descriptive of the cultural climate of the region.I am always amazed at how Holocaust victims survived the horrific events that were forced upon them.I will say that the formatting on the Kindle was not good.

"I can read a book in a day without batting an eyelash and yet it has taken me over a month to suffer through 3 of the books in this bundle.  They are just unbelievably bad. I'm shocked because I loved the Lords of the Underworld and I ran through those books like water, but these....ugh, so bad. None of the girls are likeable, none of the conflict is interesting. And like another person pointed out, all these virgin women want there men to take them roughly. If one more virgin shouts ""Harder"", I'm going to hurl. I expected better because it's Gena and I assumed one can't just turn off their ability to write. Wrong!!",2,0
"Mediocre characters combined with a mediocre plot add up to a mediocre read. I probably would have given it 3 stars just for the characterizations of the dogs (which were good), except for one annoying habit of the author. You read a chapter and go through the action with the characters. Then someone who wasn't there shows up and the entire scene you just spent 5 minutes reading is gone over again - in its entirety - for the new person. This happens several times in the book. There is even at least one instance where the same sequence is gone over three times! Just too boring. I also didn't connect with the main character. I think that the author wanted to make her seem endearing by having her completely inept at using any kind of electronic equipment, having no sense of direction, and being unable to run or even walk without falling down or tripping. In one stretch, the author spends page after page describing her trying to get into bed without falling out. I'm sure it was supposed to be ""cute"", but it just bored me. I couldn't click the forward arrow on my Kindle fast enough. I didn't like the book very much and I cannot recommend it.",2,0

"So far I am batting 0-3 for ZA Maxfield's books and writing positive reviews. I bought this book because of the stellar reviews here and on other sites and for the most part I enjoyed reading the book, but there are issues. First, the good things. The relationship between Jae and Kelly is unique and once it gets going is fun, original and hot. I like that Kelly has some quirks - OCD, his fear of leaving his house, and his obsession with Jae's hair. Z.A. Maxfield's characters in this book are crisp, three dimensional and entertaining. I also liked Will, Jae's ""houseboy,"" who I hope gets his own book. His backstory was full of heartbreak, but his strength and love for Kelly was a great part of the book. Those are the things I liked about ""ePistols at Dawn,"" now onto the things that made me give it only a 3-star rating.The first 60 pages of the book dragged - badly. I almost gave up on reading it. Too many e-mails between Kelly and Jae and too much sex between Will and Jae. At first I thought this was going to be a love story about Will and Kelly a la ""Pretty Woman,"" not Jae and Kelly. I would have liked it better if Will had just been Kelly's roommate and not his ""houseboy."" Second, the subplot about Windows and Doorways also dragged on for too long. The secret that Kelly was the author of both should have been revealed much sooner. Third, there were consent issues between Will and Kelly that made alarm bells go off in my head once it was revealed that Will was sexually abused by his stepfather, had run away from home to become a hooker, and was ""given"" to Kelly by a friend as a houseboy/lover who was leaving LA and couldn't take care of Will any longer. That subplot made me dislike Kelly for the last half of the book. Who basically forces a damaged child (Will would have been 19 when he went to live with Kelly who is in his mid-to-late 30's) to clean his house and have sex with him as payment to live there? That aspect of the book left a very bad taste in my mouth. I know the whole ""houseboy and all-around slut"" thing was supposed to be humorous, I did not find it so. Maxfield should have had Will and Kelly just as roommates, as the dubious consent issues in that relationship were irritating.So, while there were aspects of ""ePistols at Dawn"" I did enjoy, I cannot give it a ringing endorsement.",3,1

"I thought I was downloading a sample and instead got a complete short story.  Of course it is resolved too quickly,  being only 25 pages (or so it felt,  I read it in about half an hour)  Holly is tired of being a good girl so introduces herself as Jessica to the good looking guy at the club,  then they fall into a broom closet and have amazing sex. Connor loved the sex but surprises himself and wants more. When he meets ""Jessica' again,  he goes for it, but she has enough on her plate and only wants him for sex. So he gives her sex,  but wants a rel.  Eventually he tells off her sister and rebalances her life,  she worries about him when he goes on mission,  and they reunite as a couple.

"Joe loves his life as he has a great job building bridges around the world, lives in a wonderful house in Saltburn by the sea, and has no dangling relationships.  However, being away a lot, Joe needs a house sitter to walk Wolf, but she must respect his quiet.  He advertises in the Cleveland Gazette.  London manicurist Tess applies for the position.  She arrives for the interview with her eighteen month old daughter Em.  Although he wants no noisy children and does not like the fact she never mentioned Em, Joe gives her the job temporarily mostly because she likes the garden.Joe and Tess forge a tentative relationship, but he finds it odd that she fears beaches.  As they begin to open up to one another, Joe learns Em's dad is Dick an irresponsible singer while Tess finds out why he relishes bridge building.  As their threat of leaving abates, an attraction grows between them, but though he reaches out into the darkness with a need to be a Friend and Lover to her and a father to Em, her fears cripple her from crossing the bridge.Although the reason for Tess' trauma seems a bit weak, fans will appreciate this contemporary romance starring a reclusive male and a neurotic female.  The support cast to include Em and Tess' BFF Tamison and sister Claire are bridges to the story line as they anchor past and present.  Readers will enjoy this engaging tale of a traumatized single mom finding love but contentment is much harder to achieve.Harriet Klausner",4,1

I liked the action and fight scenes and was able to follow it.

I got this bundle from the library and knew there was a 4th book Tempting that I just bought and started reading. The first book in this book was sizzle which I was lost most of the time. I read fast and a lot waiting for kids at activities and I love fools gold by Susan Mallery so I kept with it then decided to look into it further and realized that I was reading the 3rd book first. I never usually do that as 90% you can tell and are lost.  I loved the series when I read them in the correct order and went back to read sizzle and it was so much better after reading the first 2 books. I have purchased and read lots of bundles and they are never out of order.,3,1
"Ava was just looking for a distraction when she came upon Derek. On vacation with nothing but forgetting on her mind; she is awestruck when she spot Derek walking solo on the beach below her balcony. What starts here is a romance of white hot chemistry that will carry readers through this short story at lighting speeds. Both main characters are scarred, but what they find together offers the light of hope for happiness. Both carrying reasons to forget leads them to a hopping night club where they will fall into one another's arms desperate for a release. What they find is far more than a night of forgetting, but rather someone that all of the past scars have been leading them right too. I love this story!

I didn't like the ending and that is one flaw I seem to find with short stories.

"#MAJOR SPOILERS IN REVIEW#I picked up the second book on the advise of another reviewer. I did not realize it was part of a series, so I bought ""A Red-Tainted Silence"" to make sure I had background on all the characters from the second book, ""Long Way Home."" Now I am dreading reading book two because I really did not enjoy this book.While the writing was solid and Ms. Gray shows promise as a romance writer the plot completely failed in its execution for me. Why? Completely unrealistic and melodramatic. I felt as if I was watching a Spanish telenova as at the end of every chapter there was a major reveal or cliffhanger which got more and more unbelievable as the long novel progressed. By the time I got to the dead deer in the protagonists' bed, this was very nearly a do not finish for me. But I held out, hoping that the book would improve -- it didn't.The characterizations of Brandon and Nick were fine, in fact, I loved that they fell in love at first sight and endured so much together, but the plot ultimately dragged the love story down. I knew who the bad guy was 15 pages in, so that big reveal at the end was not a surprise. The bad guy's motivations made no sense to me and so I was lost there.Also, for people with triggers, this is not the book for you. There are multiple rapes in it. MULTIPLE. Nick isn't abused once, but many times by many people, as is the other main character, Brandon. The rapes were the main focus of the plot and I hate it when sexual assault is used as a plot device. That did not work for me and was another unrealistic part of the book.I thought I was getting a book about two rock stars in the closet and their relationship woes. What I got was a stalker-rapist-thriller that did not work on any level. First the police procedure was not researched. When one of the main characters is kidnapped the FBI are not involved, just local police. Second, when crazy stalker sets off a bomb, the ATF are not called in to investigate. And lastly when does protective custody mean Rolling Stone reporters can come in interview and take pictures of where the persons in protective custody are hiding? Wouldn't that make it easy for the bad guys to find you? Hello.I just needed a little realism for this, just a little. What could have been a great love story between two bandmates turned into a angst-fest of rape, violence and a convoluted plot that had so many unbelievable twists and turns I gave up 35% of the way in. Not recommended.(I hope book two is better and has less drama, stalkers and rapes because hot rock stars in love is a favorite plot of mine.)",2,0
"These stories were entertaining, but by the end of the fourth one I had had enough of the macho men and their perfection.  These guys are harder to believe in than vampires and werewolves.  Real men? no so much!",4,1
I have to say I was a little disappointed in the ending of this series. The way things came about and the way the women were handling things were more irritating than endearing.,3,1
"I'm all for a short erotica, but there was no erotica to this short story.  This idea could have been turned into a long hot and steamy in depth novel but it was lacking in development.  Skipped conversations and dialogues made you feel left out of the story.  Sex was nothing to write home about, not recommended by me sorry.",1,0

Both main characters where great I love all what Zack did, very sneaky but smart. Arielle was not a push over she was strong where she needed to be but gave in when she needed too. I love that they where made for each other perfect. I loved this book and can say it was worth reading. Enjoy......",5,1
Great story. Very original theme. Hawke is a realistic character and his non-judgemental relationship.with the women of the night is refreshing. Dancer is the villain that you love to hate.  I really enjoyed the storyline and all the bases for the satisfactory completion of this story were present.,5,1
This was my first audio book that I listened to all the way through. I really liked how the narrator wasn't monotone in her reading. I would have liked to get more on the story of Emma and the school dance and how Kaylee came into this gift. All in all for this book being free I was quite impressed on the over all story. Kaylee and Lydia's bonding was one of my favorite parts as well as Lydia sacrificing herself for Kaylee.,5,1
"The basic set up - King Henry VIII didn't die, but went secretly into exile on a remote island along with William, a son he sired off of some maid or other. Seventeen years pass and then Henry decides to return to England and put William on the throne (!!!), but first there's this little problem of his daughter Elizabeth being queen and all...I'll not spoil, but what follows is some of the most preposterous nonsense I've come across since the incredibly direHeir Apparent, although at least that one was bad enough that it was actually funny. This is not. As some other reviewers have already noted this book is heavy on dialog (some rather bad), and rather light on the plot - and a very silly plot it is. I'll just leave this off with a few quotes so that you can decide for yourself whether or not it's worth your time.Queen Elizabeth:""She filled the space like a million bright lights and effortlessly wafted in front of the prisoners. Her dress seemed to be cast solid, never giving indication that legs worked to carry her across the floor.""A verbal exchange between Elizabeth and her father:""Ah! You die! Most miserably and most horribly tomorrow. And the entire city of London shall hear you scream in pain. So be it, even if I have to operate the rackmaster myself. I will know no pity.""""I will welcome the torture, and I will open my arms to death in all its magnificence. So say what you like. I care not if you end my life, and I care not if this man is subjected to the same end. Whore!""Our lovesick swain:""In the day, I long to be the sun spread in your lap, and in the night to be the dark that wraps you tight.""""Her voice was absolutely majestic, sounding like an unearthly lark.""""The virgin king,"" he whispered, his arms falling helplessly to the sides--his entire body was limp with the exception of one luxury. And his luxury remained unwavering.""I won't spoil at that last one but I promise you your eyes will roll.",1,0
"Eden LaCroix was trying to save the community center she was committed to preserving when Billy Buchanan breezed into her office announcing he was the engineer brought in as the consultant on the project.  She couldn't believe her eyes because the last time she had seen him he had literally fled, leaving her with her prom dress around her ankles at the Motel 6, ten long years ago.  She hadn't missed the almost physical relationship they had, but the friend that she trusted and confided in.Billy had reached a crossroads in his life.  He was at the top of his game in his professional life, but nothing else in his life satisfied him.  When he was asked to consult on a project in his hometown, he jumped at it.  Eden had never been far from his thoughts, and now he was going home to claim the woman made for him.  He didn't expect this to be an easy journey for him because his treatment of her so many years ago had been nothing short of abysmal.  His behavior was only one barrier keeping them apart, and the other was that his decision on the community center would have such a huge impact on Eden's life.  Billy could very well be stripping her job out from under her if his recommendation is to condemn the current building housing the center.  With all the issues circling them, Eden tried to resist the pull she felt toward Billy, but it was inevitable that they succumb to the intense heat between them.Eden is a strong character that has not had an easy life, but the loss of Billy was one loss she never recovered from.  Billy realized his error in judgment early on, and was back to claim the woman that had held his heart since high school.  While Eden scrambled to keep her armor in place, Billy did everything he could think of to penetrate it.  Well-rounded characters, but the story is not up to the caliber I expect from this author, but still an enjoyable read.",4,1

"I normally try to appreciate each author's voice and the story's individual tone, but none of this made sense to me. It went from sing-song to brutal -- or at least hints at brutal -- and I didn't follow much of anything in between. Bottom line: I'm bewildered.",2,0
"The positive:  The book is very well written with tight scenes and well-developed characters.The negative:  I could not bring myself to like Briony.  Her constant daydreams about the perfect Master quickly became irritating as well as highlighting her shallow materialism.  The many insertions of e-mails from an online BDSM dating website were disturbing and really didn't add to the story of Chris and Briony.  In fact, the majority of the story wasn't about the relationship between Chris and Briony, but was about Briony's neurotic need to find the ""One"" and the destructive behavior in which she indulges.I completely agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned that the first-hand style of writing hampered this story.  I found it difficult to understand why Chris would want Briony when I had no clue to his thoughts.",2,0
I don't want to give away the crazy twist that totally shocked me but I loved this book I was sad to see some people who I really liked die in the book but the ending made up for that sorta.. but don't take my word for it read this book!!!! I can't wait to read book ll.,4,1

"I'm always interested in threesomes with real sexual relationships between all three people. And this supplied that, so it gets stars for that. But it's characterizations were weak and everyone was too perfect. Firstly I was annoyed that the two men were called Jace and Jasper, which were so similar as to be confusing. And sunny Sarah was just so sweet and friendly but also full of exceptionally hot fantasies that she had no hestiation in carrying out. Sadly it just wasn't that well written. This is the second Cameron Dane book I've bought and it will be the last, they have interesting premises but her writing just doesn't deliver. (The crime aspect was also really weak.)",3,1
"There were a few things that I liked singularly in this story, especially the friend-to-lovers theme and the fact that Will, who is the quiet guy, had an unexpected dominant streak, but this fact was also what brought me out of the story a bit, because I see the book is tagged BDSM and I didn't really feel it as a theme of the book. There's also something that made me almost mad: Will's colleague is expecting him for dinner to set him up with her brother, he knows he has to go, but then he is caught up in his confrontation with Ethan and that fact is not mentioned anymore. I know one can't expect everything to be tied up, but what was the point? There was something good and intense in the story, but there was also something over-the-top and not deep enough. It's probably more 2.5*, but I liked Will a lot, so I'll bump it up a bit.",3,1
I enjoyed reading this book. It kept me interested from start to finish. It was hard to put down. Definitely worth purchasing this good short read.,5,1

Trite and repetitive - why do gay novels generally tend to be little more than a series of strung togther sex scenes with little narrative content ad even less literary value.  Come on guys we deserve better than this.  The theme of issues of being openly gay in sport is raised but the the novel closes before the consequences of being out are seen and the story developed.  Mills and Boon for gay men with sex included!  An hour's read at best with little characterisation or story outside the sex scenes.,2,0
"This is an update of my original review...The content of the Kindle version of WSJ is very similar to what you would find getting the print edition delivered.  There are some things missing such as stock quotes but that's ok because it's easier to look up and read stock quotes and such on the web.  The format makes navigating the paper a bit cumbersome.  Graphs, photos, and other graphics are poor in the Kindle format.  It helps that this subscription comes with WSJ Online and iPhone access.  WSJ Online is very good and the iPhone app is terrible.  Not only is the content via the iPhone app incomplete, you have to put up with ads!Considering the new cost of $21.62/month or $.072/day I think the cost for electronic format is way overpriced considering its deficiencies.

Veiled Eyes (Lake People)I am not going to go into a lot of detail about this book.  The story was weird.  The people were weird. Seemed like some strange incestuous community.

"I've read the entire series now--which is why this book has a 4 Star.  I reserve 5 stars for the ""best books I've ever read"".  While it is a 4 star review, it by no means should give the reader the idea that it wasn't a really entertaining read.I love Simon and Becky.  I would have liked it if the love scenes in the series weren't so very similar, though.  It was a hot, steamy read for sure.As I said, I got the entire series--after reading the first book--which should tell you that it was a worthwhile reading experience.As with other reviews, there is no need for me to tell the story--it's been done elsewhere.One question:  HOW does Becky always know the phone is ringing?  It was an interesting twist--that I wish had been played out and explained--or somehow worked into the plot.  -- Part of the reason I gave this book 4 stars as well, to be honest, rather than 5.

I just felt too in the dark and didn't make enough connection with any of the characters.  After reading other's reviews it sounds like if I'd read the other books, I wouldn't feel this way.  Don't know if I'll ever find out.  Sex was hot, but even that felt a bit ridiculous to me --""I'm jealous, but I'm not really and it is ok this time because you won't do it again, so go ahead and say goodbye"" (I don't always get men sharing a woman, so read this with that in mind)",2,0

"Wow.  This is a story that had a ton of imagination behind it.  The idea was definitely inspired, and for once a newer author allowed the characters plenty of free reign.  The characters drive the action in this story, with their backstories and personalities meaning something.Sadly, the story desperately needed someone who could have reigned in the writers.Early chapters are flooded with ""info-dumps"" where several pages suddenly start explaining the planet the heroes are visiting, or some aspect of the technology in the universe.  This left the story rather disjointed, and the early chapters do not flow very well.Later the info-dumps diminish, only to be replaced by multiple page flashbacks.  The flashbacks are solidly written, tell rather complete tales, and probably would have been much better as their own seperate stories, in building towards this tale.  Some of them were definitely necessary to help reveal the personalities, but others again disrupt the flow of the story.The biggest problem though was the characters themselves.  Maeve and Coldhand both possess damaged psyches and events from their past drive their actions throughout the story.  This could have worked very well, but both are rather unsympathetic due to the extremely unflattering ways they are described.  Maeve as a broken junkie who refuses to allow anyone to become her friend and Coldhand's quiet madness due to the injuries that left him with a cybernetic heart and hand.And of course, as the first book of a trilogy, only a couple minor plot threads come to any kind of closure or completion.  The ending was more of a place that the story ran out of steam than a clear stopping point.Overall, this is not a very good book.  The writers have lots of talent and the story is impressive in its complexity and scope, but an editor was needed to weed out all of the asides that show up as info-dumps and flashbacks, and to tighten up the revelatoins of backstories so that they smoothly fit into the story rather than overwhelming the middle part of the story.  Even the appearance of the major antagonists could be improved as the enemy appears out of nowhere about 40% into the book.The sequel will be interesting, hopefully the authors will be less inclined to throw extra information at the reader but will continue to allow their characters to grow as the story develops.",3,1

"Another collection of short stories, and like the first anthology (No Good Deed), the connection to the River City novels is in there, it's just not always prevalent. And similar to the first anthology, the final product is uneven at best. There are a few good stories, but many of the offerings remind me of what a high school course of Beginning Story-Writing would produce. Some of these are so bad they left me seriously considering abandoning the rest of the book. Instead of 17 short stories, many of which were too short on plot, detail, and ending, I'd have preferred half as many stories with somewhat more complete and conclusive plotlines. The book's final story (Alan Hart) was well worth the price of admission, but I had to slog through an uneven bunch of good, so-so, and downright bad stories to get there. FWIW, I absolutely loved the first three River City novels, but so far these anthologies leave a lot to be desired, in my opinion.",2,0
"This is a short tale that doesn't feel like just another short story.  It's a fantasy.  It's a horror.  It's a fairy tale.  It's a detective novel.  This novella actually crosses many different genres and styles and makes for an entertaining afternoon's read.The society and social structure of the town or Rannit is hinted at but not explored in any detail.  Religions, curfews and trolls are presented as if they are common knowledge - and that makes them intriguing. I'm glad there are other books set in this world as I want to get to know it better.Tuttle's writing style is tight and entertaining.  My first thought when I finished reading was it felt like reading some Poe only the lighter, more amusing version.  I really like that I didn't know where the story was going as well as not knowing who would live and who would die.  It's a lot like Neil Gaiman in that respect.",4,1
"The title for this review reflects the considerable influence that the Tom Swift series has had on science and technology n America. Visionaries like Steve Wozniak and Issac Asimov have cited it as part of their inspiration, and it was certainly part of mine when I was growing up (I went into math and physics as fields).The series is regarded as ""edisonade"" in character, that is, using inventors like Thomas Edison as the basis for the fictional character. The books, at least in the initial series which began in 1910, featured inventions and technology that had been or was close to being realized. The later Tom Swift series became more fantastic in tone. Many of he books are now in the public domain, but the character is still continuing (owned by Simon and Schuster, I believe), and a feature film was announced in 2008.The Tom Swift books were written in four different series. The books ncluded in this collection (26 of them) were from the first series and appeared in 1910-1932 and 1939. The last two books shown appeared in 1962. Their author, Victor Appleton or Victor Appleton II, was actually the pseudonym for a variety of different authors.My rating reflects the reverence that I have for my own memories of reading these books as a boy. At the time, I enjoyed them immensely. However, that was many, many years ago.hen I perused this particular collection, it was clear that the Tom Swift series was not aging very gracefully, and the technology being described doesn't hold the interest as well as it once did. Still, the books serve as a good source for insight into the beginnings of American science fiction.Anyone purchasing this particular edition should also be prepared for some poor formatting. The text is run together without proper breaks, and headings are not centered. The overall effect was so distracting that I finally returned the content to Amazon for a refund. Please consider that many of the Tom Swift novels in this collection are available as free Kindle editions. Rather than spend your money on this edition, you might check out the free ones to make sure you really want to spend your money to get all these works at once.",4,1

"This story follows the adventures of a cat who is pretty much thrown away when his beloved caretaker dies.  His journey to safety takes him through swamps, back roads, snow storms, dog fighting and a feral cat colony.  Some humor, but clouded by a sadness because the reader knows that while this is fiction many of these hardships and tragedies do happen everyday to many cats.",5,1
"Inside every woman is a romantic. No matter how sophisticated one had become or how modern our world had turned out to be, a small part of us still believe in fairytales and Prince Charming. And speaking of a modern world, how many among us romantics fantasize that we will meet THE ONE in our favorite club or favorite hang out.Because, this is what this story is all about. Carson and Holly met in a club, which for lack of a better description is where couples hook up. And Carson and Holly hooked up alright. They just did not realize the consequences of their actions.And that is what makes this short story interesting. There is not a lot of conflict because it is a fantasy come true. The sex scenes pack heat but not actually sizzling. Holly and Carson are likeable and I wish that the book is at least a novella or better yet, a full novel. I would have love to see more character development.But, it is what it is - an enjoyable and quick read. This book is Rated M for mature due to sex.",3,1
"The Delver world is most believable and truly detailed.With magic on the loose, there are strange happenings, old boundaries are broken and attacks of vengeance are made.With this second book... we see more of the interactions between all the different races and humans... as the fight for survival is on. Intense battles.I found this book a good follow to book one of the series, Delver Magic.Ryson Acumen, the delver... is the hero and is in the center of all the action. It's a great fight between good and evil set in a believable world that captures me and makes me look around curiously when I surface from the reading and make the transition back to my world and life!The ending of this book leaves many unresolved issues and I am eagerly looking forward to reading book 3!If you love fantasy, like action, enjoy watching strong characters learn and grow, like a touch of paranormal... you'll enjoy this book. I highly suggest you read the first book in the trilogy first.",4,1

In addition she can't decide which one she's attracted to if she can overcome her trust issues.

They have been ready and now is the time!

Delightful read for the Kindle. Suspenseful for a who done it Book. Twists and turns to make you wonder who the murderer was...certainly not expected.,4,1
"I liked the main characters, both nicely masculine.  I liked the sex scenes, though one was kind of a do-over which felt a little false.  Expanding the story beyond their little microcosm would've been good.  But the story was kind of like a house of cards, individual pieces work, but the whole thing rested on underpinnings that didn't make sense.  Also, the start of the book keeps going back and forth in time, telling you there are things you don't know, but slowly stringing them out for no reason.  It is an annoying construct, which the author thankfully moves past later in the book. There are some tragic aspects to the book, which the author tries to explain given they are wolves, but I think a good editor would've been really helpful in structuring the book and making it more logical.",3,1

"I remember going to the movie theatre when about 56/7 yrs old. with my cousin 4 years older.  We enjoyed it so much that we staye through a second showing--and got into huge trouble!  I saw the book's availability and realized that I'd never actually read the book.  It did not disappoint.  At our upcoming family reunion, I'd like to share that movie experience with my grandkids--but am sending them the book to enjoy first.",5,1
"I don't know about this short story, but I do know that I loved the hero; and probably nothing more out of this book. I mean the plot was a little different and cool, I mean with the New Year's Eve conspiracy against vampires; but the action was not described as thoroughly as you would expect. And that is the only reason that I am giving the book 3 stars, because of the overall plot.",3,1
"This story could have been so much more - great characters, good plot but it was so short to allow for character development so the believability was very thin. Nevertheless, still a good read for the $2.66 price tag",3,1

"The premise was great I thought but no sooner had I started the book than I wanted to stop. I couldn't find one redeeming factor in Nikias just plain arrogance and so overbearing I wanted to scream. As for Diona please, give me a break, where's the backbone girl. I don't care how good a kisser he was supposed to be you do not keep just falling in bed with a jerk who obviously has no respect or regards for you to even find out if you are telling the truth until it slaps him in the face. I got this story for free so I felt it necessary to finish the book but could easily have stopped after the first few chapters. Having said all of this please keep writing, get yourself an editor and work more on the character development a little more detailing would go a long way, leave out some of the sex (I can't believe I said that) and concentrate on giving us the characters we love to love not the ones we crave to hate.",2,0
"okay, I bit the bait...downloaded the freebie...and was totally blown away.  I have gotten very disillusioned by the crappy vampire books out there.  This one was going to be the last free download of that genre I ever did.  I greatly enjoyed Two and Theroen's story.  The twists and turns kept me very interested and I read it all in one sitting.  The plot was well thought out, the characters (at least I thought so) were very well developed. I could not wait to get the rest of the series, which I devoured in 2 days...I will be putting Buecheler on my list of authors to read...I loved it!",4,1

"I normally do not like to read short IR stories because the authors try too hard to put everything into the plot which leaves the plot and characters unfinished.  Luckily, this author took a different approach and rather than supply a complete history of the characters relationship, she just wrote about a moment in their lives.  The characters were likable, the passion hot, and the story complete.  I absolutely recommend this short story.  Great job Ms Brandi Nicole!",4,1
"With so much potential, this book was a crushing let down. I read about 20% to give it a fair shake, but the dialog was stilted and characters flat. It might be a decent read for a kid in the 5th or 6th grade...the syntax was about on that level. I was very disappointed and deleted it from my Kindle.",1,0
"I enjoyed this book entirely, it is definely UNIQUE. I liked that the vampires are different not your garden variety vampire. They are immortals, but not the suck your blood and hunt you down type either, just the normal everyday person with extra powers.... some with even more than others. I like that Heather Killough-Walden takes these genres and makes them into something different, so that you feel like you are not reading the same old thing over and over just by a different author.I thought also that this was interesting since I was brought up in a home that was taught biblcally that there was references to the bible. I wasn't discouraged, by it because I am secure in my faith though. I have my own beliefs,  this is a work of fiction and it didn't bother me, but I could see where it could bother others, since it does talk negatively towards faith in general. I enjoyed this story entirely and I look forward to another from this series when it comes out.This book starts out with a mother and a toddler being stalked and being shot at in a parking lot. Then to make matters worse dying......to save your daughter...what a story..I loved it.",4,1

"After reading Ms. Heaton's Vampire Realm series (at least to the 5th book) I thought I would try her ""Angel"" series.  I must say, I'm glad I only spent .99 on this waste of 2.5 hours of my time.  There was absolutely no rhyme or reason to how things began with the main characters. (Again, I do NOT summarize what I've read in order for those who are reading reviews to get the whole story in a summary, which is actually kind of hard to do in this case!) The story line is so weak and has gaping holes it, I was left scratching my head asking myself what the heck was going on since there wasn't much explanation for anything!  There was no conflict, there was no climax, there was no reason left to even WANT to read a second book in this series.  The book itself was short enough to be a short story, and in my opinion, if they're all this short, they should be grouped together in one book and sold that way.  I will NOT be continuing on with this series as this book just didn't check even half my boxes.  Sorry Ms. Heaton, I've read better from you.  Total disappointment.",2,0
"Apart from the much too detailed view of his world and everything happening, his imagination and creative story are fairly good. Its just filled with too much detail making it a slow read.",3,1
This series has it all! This author is one of my favorites. She writes an awesome plot that keeps you on edge all the time! She can also write some sensually descriptive hot scenes between the characters!! And don't forget to read Dark Wolf Rising after you finish with this series! It's even better than these and the plot thickens! VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! AND IF YOU LIKE THESE YOU WILL LOVE THE EDGE SERIES!,4,1
The book looks at both sides of a zombie outbreak while giving the zombie side intelligence rather than the usual mindless wanderings you see in other books.  The book was well written with few grammatical errors. The human side was well done and more realistic as the characters were not prepared and were not ex-military in any way.  This in itself led to somewhat believable situations (As believable in a situation where zombies are real).  For free read it you will like it.,4,1
"Nikki Kincaid is all about control in her private and personal life.  Professionally, Nikki is a racecar driver who is zeroing in on a championship.  However, her personal life seems to be stalled and now Nikki has collected a stalker--not something she has time to deal with right now.  Her brother has put an even bigger pain in her way this weekend besides a hard race.Adam Guthrie is a Dom and a detective who also happens to be a good friend to Nikki's brother.  Adam has wanted Nikki since meeting her, but the timing hasn't been right.  He is positive that Nikki is a sexual submissive, if only she would give him a chance to show her it can be a wonderful and fulfilling experience when it's between the right people.Adam has five days in which to protect Nikki, try and find out who is sending the letters and to show Nikki just what they could have together.  Nikki believes that there is just something wrong with anyone who would submit to games or allow someone to control them sexually.  However, as emotions get crazier, Nikki wonders if Adam just might be right and if he is the one person she can trust to give up control to.Reaction Time is all about control--having it and getting it.  Nikki has had to be the leader in her family, her race team and her love life.  Right now, only her race team is at the top of its game.  One out of three is not good odds.  Adam knows just what control is and the pleasure it can give, he just needs time to show Nikki.  The stalker is a perfect reason for time alone for Adam and Nikki. That is step one down.  Watching Adam work his way through Nikki's shields and to her heart was something that kept me going.  When a Dom and his Sub come together it can and usually is erotic but if it doesn't grab at your heartstrings there is something missing.  Ms. Lynne had the combination that did both.  Reaction Time shows a Sub finding not only herself but also the Dom of her dreams.  An erotic and loved-filled story that will keep you warm on a winter's nightJoReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",5,1
"Ok, I did not enjoy the first book because it did not focus on the love connection of Mr. Darcy & Miss Bennett.  So, me being the forever optimist I thought surely the focus in book 2 would be on our two destined lovers.  Well, I was wrong.  Even though, I enjoy some of the character development and I so enjoy reading volumes of the related sequels, this is not the book for the hopeless regency romantic.",2,0
"While the descriptions were vivid, the story lacked any interesting characters. I also find referring to zombies as &#34;deaders&#34; quite obnoxious.

"This is a tough one to rate... It was slow paced and kind of boring at times, but it also managed to make me smile now and then.It was not an entirely boring or bad read, but nevertheless, it didn't really manage to capture my interest all that much. I didn't feel the urge to read the book in order to find out what happens next, what will happen to those two MCs. I just wasn't caught up in this book.Jae and Kelly were, on some level, interesting characters, well, interesting enough, at least. They're likable. I liked the fact that Kelly suffered from OCD, it was a good idea--attempt--, but it lacked believability at times. In my opinion, the research (by the author) on that topic fell a bit flat.And it's more or less the same with Jae's asthma: One time he's running like hell after Kelly and his ever-present sidekick Will which leads to ""the worst asthma attack Jae has had for a very long time"". So far, so good. Not quite realistic, however, is that Jae, while practically choking, can still have a conversation with Kelly at the same time. Well...There were some other things that weren't quite believable or that bothered me, but I won't list them all here. The ones above are enough. ;)The developing relationship between Kelly and Jae is sweet, I guess. I even like the houseboy-boy-toy Will, although he was annoying, sometimes.It was a nice enough read and I can't really say that I didn't like the characters or the plot itself, but the book never really was engaging enough, though. I can't really say why, but it just wasn't my thing. There wasn't enough thrill for me, I guess. Tastes differ.",3,1
"""Dani Standifer arrives home at her West Texas family ranch a day early, ready to pick up where she left off with Rowe Ayers, her high school sweetheart. However, when she opens the door to their line-shack trysting place, it's clear she waited a day too long. Rowe's with someone else--another man.And not just any other man--Justin Cruz, the bad boy with whom she shared one wild encounter, years ago.""This novella is a lethal combination of dreadful sex writing, shallow characterization and unbelievable plot. The loving stalker and the ""we're not gay, we just love each other"" m/m are two of my least favorite tropes, and they're present in full force.To start off, a stint in Justin's POV informs us that he watched Dani for years from afar, keeping his hands off her for years because she was too young. This watching included her trysts with Rowe in the line-shack. I gather Devlin intended this to show Justin's attraction to Dani and how it differed from his fleeting attractions to other women, but it came off as predatory and stalkeriffic. That's a steep hill to climb to regain my respect to be a believable hero, and the novella isn't anywhere near long enough for that.The sex scenes are truly dreadful. They contain such gems as ""The sight of her pale blonde ruff and the deep pink, inner lips framing her entrance, took his breath away."" and ""The slick, wet sounds they made as they came together were just nasty enough to thrill her, and the familiar musky scent and feel of the man working above her smoothed away the edges from her earlier unrest."" The language was on par with free erotic shorts and the imagery anywhere from puzzling (""working?"" really?) to gross, but never erotic. It lacked the subtlety, the tension building and feeling necessary to convey attraction or arousal. Ostensibly these are people who love each other, yet, beyond saying the words to each other, they do nothing to show me love exists here.Dani's brother is portrayed as an impediment to their desire to be a threesome, but his character is woefully undeveloped. As quickly as he appears as an opposing force he disappears, dropping his dissent in a two line conversation. Why bother creating his character in the first place.Altogether, Unbridled is an underwhelming effort from Devlin, who is capable of much better work.",1,0
"4.25 StarsWEDDING BELL BLUES can be read on it's own, but I would not recommend it - as the personalities that I know and love takes a back seat to the drama of the wedding in this second book, but they creep in every now and again and without reading the first book, you will definately be missing out.The book starts off with small town Konigsburg preparing for the wedding of the year, now that Docia has agreed to marry Cal. As with all not normal wedding with a hyperactive mother of the bride - everything went bigger and larger than life and it is only with the buffer of Docia best gal pal Janie Dupree is she able to survive the day to day angst of her mother.Janie is sweet, really sweet and most everyone that meets her know immediately that she is a push over. There is a however a strand of steel that runs through Janie, but she never shows it but at the rate at which the wedding plans are going downhill it might just make an appearance. While Janie is working her butt off to make every little thing as perfect as possible for the big day - her support which is suppose to be the bestman - could not have a care in the world.Pete Toleffson is the bestman and his motto is ""if  Cal wants something done Cal will ask and if he is not asked it wasn't worth doing"". Pete is Cal's older brother and not that he is not happy for his brother, but he wants no part of the horse and pony show that was happening - this level of happiness was just something that was un-natural for Pete. Pete is a lawyer in his hometown and surprises of surprises the office is getting on fine without him, then there is Cal, he has not stopped smiling since Pete has been in Konigsburg - it's just not natural, then to top the whole mess off, the cute little pixie of a bridesmaid wants to tell him what is role is in this carnival of chaos.Things were bound to come to a head and Pete and Janie was more or less pushed together to stop the wedding train derailing. While they battle the forces of in-laws, family dramas, personality issues and even issues closer to home they find the budding seeds of attraction and appreciation growing between them.They are not fools and they make the best of what is there for them - because Pete must eventually go home and Janie is under no illusion that she has what it takes to hold a man like Pete in Konigsburg.How man ways can I say I love this book. I was determined to  read this before the end of the year and I was so pleased I did that this weekend. WEDDING BELL BLUES is a convoluted mess of comical what if's, that did eventually happen and it was a fun read.I must mention Meg Benjamin's skill first at keeping at the going ons in Konigsburg together and in a straight line, because the chaos was coming from all angles and  everyone had drama or trauma as the case might be. She still managed to maintain that small town feel to her writing style and along with some creative language. The uptight and upright new cast she introduce in this book was a perfect fit to the laid back and irreverent lot of Konigsburg.WEDDING BELLS BLUES is Pete's and Janie's story - even if it was wrapped up the carnival of Docia's wedding. Janie knew right from the moment Docia agreed to a wedding date that she was not going to do it without Janie and Janie got into the spirit of things and at time she almost feels like a dogsbody.  She kiss ass, she sucked up and she made nice and denies alot of what she wanted to get off her chest just for the sake of seeing things through to the end.Even when the bestman started looking like he had two heads for his incompetence as a bestman, she still was sweetness itself. In all that sweetness however Janie had issues closer to home - a nosey demanding mother, a almost boyfriend who will be anything but and a town that she is just coming to see the beauty of, even if it was not her first love.Meeting Pete sets off an emotional chain reaction that she was not stepping away from and she was willing to roll with the punches wherever they take her, even if it's only for a short while, no matter how she wish it was more.Pete is a heart attack waiting to happen - he gives the appearance of laid bad with not a care in the world - a whole new meaning, but underneath he was a bundle of nerves worried about job, home, family and just life in general. Janie crawled under his skin an inch at a time and he was not opposed to what it was doing to him but he was not in the business of hurt - and he had no intention of staying in Konigsburg and this he knew without a doubt will hurt Janie.The highlight of this book for book was it's natural flow from  VENUE IN BLUE JEANS, it build on the special relationships that were being formed in that first book. With an array of characters and side stories popping up, some so everyday it was comical in it's realness.I loved themI hated themand mostly, I wanted to drop a few of them in a vat of oil.But one thing I did was laugh with this book and I laughed alot.Because of this flow from book to book, I would not recommend reading this book without reading VENUE IN BLUE JEANS first because you would miss out on what made these characters who they are.All the issues that befalls a wedding and more is presented in this book and this was one of the more meatier side story, which will ultimately be the cornerstone and why we will are destined to get two more Toleffson men story. I am so looking forward to those as these Toleffson men are rouges and lovers alike.Bottom LineIf you are looking for a read that just hits the spot - with small town issues aplenty, nosey community with no remorse about being nosey and at anytime you just never know what will come out of their mouth - this is the book for you. Scandal, spite and a good fisticuff are just apart of the everyday order of Konigsburg. With loveable characters and everyone having a opinion on everything - Janie And Pete are a blessed calm in the storm - that is until they start creating their own waves.",4,1
"No SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Short, cat shifter romance- predictable and basic, but sexy and sweet at the same time. Book 1 of the series. It's a quick read, a simple story, easily forgotten, but you'll enjoy it while you've got it- like cotton candy. Also like cotton candy there will be moments when you want to roll your eyes at how incredibly sweet (or corny) it is. There is no hard, brutal edge to this story.PLOT: There really isn't one and for a day at the beach, that's ok. You're looking for para-romance, then this will cover it. Not really erotica- the sex is simple and straightforward, but HOT all the same.CHARACTERS: Stereotypical- dominant male, sassy, but smaller female protected by big brothers. No development.BOTTOM LINE: This isn't a great book, but it will get you there. If you are looking for something reassuring where the nice guys win, there's hot sex involved and the characters can turn into big angry lions with huge teeth, then this is for you. But don't look for anything other than that.RECOMMENDATIONS: (these are all pretty basic shifter-centric para-romance)1. R.G. Alexander's steamy vampire/were/witch romance series:Regina in the Sun (Children of the Goddess)2. Vivian Arend'sWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1fun, light were-romance series3.

Sydney Somers' gargoyle spin on romance:Primal Hunger: Pendragon Gargoyles, Book 1FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE DEVELOPED:1. Moira Rogers' magically diverse romance seriesCrux: Southern Arcana, Book 12. Sherrilyn Kenyon'sFantasy Lover- Dark Hunter series with shifters, vamps and Greek gods. The first book is not as good as the rest- it just gets better and better.3. Christine Warren's somewhat inconsistent, but often awesome seriesWolf at the Door (The Others, Book 1)- skip the one about werecats, it had a weak female lead4. Nalini Singh'sSlave to Sensation (Psy-Changelings, Book 1)that manages a great plot in a alternate future world.5.

"This book deserves 2.5 stars. It's not the worst thing I've read, yet it wasn't the best either.The protagonist, Emily Fenwick, is a police officer who is suddenly whisked into an alternate New York set in 1890. Except it's not really an alternate New York, nor are there any scenarios that could be labeled steampunk. It's more fantasy-based with a world that I found intriguing.Emily wakes up in Steamside, a world connected to 1890's ""normal"" New York. Steamside's inhabitants are refugees like Emily who long to return to their times. Why are they here? It's not clearly explained, and that's not a good thing, which is a shame because Steamside is interesting.Rather, the setting is used more as a backdrop to a juvenile, nonsensical romance between the two leads. POVs were difficult to distinguish, and the dialogue was all jumbled up. The romance was tedious and unbelievable. Have I mentioned juvenile?It was a fun read, but Steamside Chronicles just wasn't the best.",2,0
"Cassidy is in love with her ex boyfriend Ian.  While they focus on their friendship and business partnership, she can't help but continue to love him.  They share a house and their lives but that is all.  Cassidy wants more.Ian is scared to commit.  Scared of being hurt he pushes away those that mean the most to him; hence why he and Cassidy are now friends instead of the lovers Ian wants them to be.Kye McClellan is a gypsy of sorts. A jack of all trades, he enjoys helping out where he is needed.  He never stays in any place too long before he wants to enjoy freedom again.  When he goes home with Cassidy to help her with her business and financial records, Kye never expected to suddenly want a home and hearth.  And that scares the heck out of him. Before he leaves, however, he will try his best to get Ian and Cassidy together in each other's arms, where they belong not knowing that he will want to be the final part of their triad.Not a typical m&eacute;nage romance, Our Man Friday is a bit different.  I am used to having one couple already established prior to inviting a third and so the fact that Ian and Cassidy were just friends was original to me.  Cassidy's invitation to Kye was a bit far fetched because in this day and age, I don't see anyone inviting an unknown stranger into their home to sort through and look at financial records.  Kye was hot, I'll give him that but he angered me more than once the times he left Ian and Cassidy.  Ian and Cassidy's relationship evolved into something beautiful thanks to Kye.Our Man Friday by Claire Thompson is erotic and naughty.  The emotions of the characters are realistic but I just didn't buy into Kye's commitment to Ian and Cassidy.  I felt he was gratuitous towards them.  As a m&eacute;nage, Our Man Friday is scorching hot; as a true love match between all three characters of the m&eacute;nage? Not so much. I would skip this book unless you are a die hard Claire Thompson fan.TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",3,1
"This is a pretty good young adult story.  The story-telling is a little trite, but the author makes up for it with very adult subject matter and a good knowledge of survival skills.  My main objection is the author's grammar and word usage.  This is not everyone's strong point, so having a skilled editor to check your book over is a must if you want to write.  This author has a hard time with possessives--both singular and plural, seems unsure of the difference between ""it's"" and ""its"" and repeatedly uses the phrase ""use to"" as in, ""They weren't use to powdered milk.""  It's supposed to be ""used to"".  These seem like small quibbles, but many people judge writing both by content and by skill with spelling and grammar. An otherwise good story can be diminished by poor word skills.",4,1

"a good coming of age book and information that you need to know what you are looking at before you make a judgment of its' worth.  I thought it was a good book about a corner of the west that I had little knowledge of and am respectful of those who live there, and glad I was born more north.",5,1
"Bait to buy?This ""book/short"" is really just a full blown ad for his other book.Chapter one starts 10% into the ""book"" - after 10% of reviews for Beyond Justice.  Then this ""tale"" goes to the 49% mark.  With the last 50% dedicated to an excerpt os BJ.  Well, after a brief word from the ""sponser"" (author).The meager 39% dedicated to the ""hero"" is a TELL - nothing shown.  Though with the length I suppose there was no alternative for the writer.When I got this a while ago, it was not listed in Christian.  The one sentence description says ""redemption"" - but in a mystery /thriller (which this is listed under genre wise) that could hold meaning other than someone finding God.  It is not uncommon for teasers and word play - rather than literal intrepretation in such genre.  So, I was not expecting such a Christian heavy work.  That said, it was fine once I realized the case.  However, that is precicely what ruined the book as it became predictably obvious after the first Bible verse.  It is unfortunate as mysteries /thriller's should have some - well - mystery OR thrill.  None of either found here.But, the thing most frustrating is that this work was really just an offering to push another (more pricey) book.  While authors often push other works in some other novel - they do NOT devote 60% to that other book.There are a few punctuation errors and a couple word use issues - but was well edited.I won't try another from this author as I can buy a magazine if I want to read ads.Christine",1,0

"I have always loved Vampires and this story was very good!  The character of Dante is extremely exciting to me.  I loved him in the first story and in this one he was fantastic.

"Charlie and Booker felt like real,  sensitive people,  anxious to connect,  worried about miscommunication,  taking some emotional risks.  They meet at the lake,  at Charlie's new holiday house.  Booker was there in the water and caught Charlie's eye,  though Charlie was convinced Booker would turn out to be straight...  Booker's situation was complex, and Charlie's water phobia was well handled.  I liked the descriptions and the way KZ writes. Here's how Charlie describes his feelings:- (about 1/3 into the book)I was unaccountably happy.It was obvious we were both ready to crash. This long, strange day was winding down,  and we'd been drugged by the narcotic called sex. I studied Booker's face,  intrigued by its blending of youth and maturity.  He was a rough kind of handsome, and anything but ordinary.See - like soaking into a warm bath,  I could trust the sentence structure and narrative,  and enjoy my time with these men.",4,1
This book was a surprise for me.  I have had it on my Kindle for awhile but the synopsis did not catch my interest.  I was going to archive it without reading it but decided to give it a fast cursory run through.  It caught and held my attention.  I finished it in one sitting.The butler and the protagonist were the most interesting characters.  During the storm the action was a little confusing but that did not detract from the over all read.  Being a teacher I just had to make note of grammatical/typo  errors.  There were no egregious errors that detracted from the story.Is it me or do the Kindle editions of books have more errors than the paperback/hardbound books?  I have wanted to literally compare a Kindle edition to the paperback version. Guess I am too cheap and/or too busy to do this.  One day I will summon up enough interest/motivation to do this experiment.,4,1
"Man, it's a good thing this was free. For one thing, it was short. There's nothing inherently wrong with a short story, but it's surprisingly hard to write a good short story, which this was not.There was no character development, which led to no emotional connection to the characters. When Wyatt gets shot by a crossbow (which Sara manages to walk around Chicago with, no questions asked) I simply felt no empathy for him. None at all.And there was the dreaded ""I need you!"" romance based entirely on the face that the two main characters had a fantastic  hookup for a week at some point last year. Hello, authors! Wake up, that's not how romance works!",2,0

"After finishing this book, I don't know exactly how to feel.I expected to feel horrified, and at certain points I was, perhaps not at the points Steve intended, but generally speaking I felt a little disjointed.I believe this was because of the choppy way the story went from one place and time to another and then another. I don't have a solution to make it better; I just know that I didn't really get it.The introduction to the 'world' took a long time. Almost a third of the book! It held useful information, but it felt like I was being introduced to characters, ideas and concepts just to have them ripped away. You don't meet the real protagonist until about 30% in either. That meant you only had 70% of the book left in which to get to know them and feel something for them.It took a while, but eventually I did start to care for a couple of the characters. I think the kicker for me though, the turning point in my feelings for the book, revolved solely around the dog. I felt more for that wiry-haired pooch than any of the other characters. That could be because I'm an animal person, but I don't think so. In fact I believe it's got more to do with the characterisation that the dog had that the other characters were lacking.The antagonists were brilliant creations of horrific proportions, but strangely humanesque in some of their actions, protecting their young and mates for example, and so completely alien in other aspects.I didn't really appreciate the dialogue around them and their existence in their world; I think it would have been enough knowing that they came from a hellish world without all the rest of it too.The thing that kept me engaged and enjoying this story was the science/history behind the different worlds. The ley lines and the Indian culture, the standing stones and the magic that was obviously so thoroughly researched by Steve. That part of the story was steeped in so much truth that even though it was completely 'out there' I found myself wanting to believe it too.I didn't much like how things ended, but then I can't say I didn't expect it a little anyway. Steve seemed to enjoy mutilating characters, finding creative ways to dispatch them from the story and well, I guess I came to expect that any characters were potential targets, even those who deserved a second chance at things or ones who were young and innocent.This book is certainly not for the feint-hearted. It starts off slowly enough, but by the end of it you'll be wading through so much blood and guts it all just starts to blur together.This book could do with another pass over by an editor. There were plenty of little typos and formatting issues on the kindle.The things I noticed:15% - now it (was) just weeds.23% - that's what is (delete is, add it) has to do...27% - A brownish shake's (snake's)...29% - the boat ramp..

I congratulate Joe for having separated his collection into smaller, bite-size pieces which can be consumed in a short period of time.

"I think this is worth reading. I am not a big fan of the novella form- characters are usually one dimensional, stories seem rushed or overly simplistic and a little bit of background can read as dry as a law review when you are anxious to get back to the story. So I went into this expecting that. In the end, I found it didn't manage to avoid falling into those pitfalls, but I found I was pleased to have been introduced to the mythology of this world.This one was a little bit better than many novellas- the imagery is beautiful. Anyone who has spent time in a jungle would appreciate it. Very magical setting.The characters were not developed at all- I barely managed to put together a mental image of what they might look like, but the sex was hot and their attraction was palpable. Maggie and Brandt were likable enough, though you had to work hard to overlook his blatant deception that set off the whole thing. For the sake of the novella form, a reasonable back and forth between the two that would have allowed the relationship to develop had to be sacrificed. In places the passion short circuited rational thought, but Ms. Feehan managed to maintain the integrity of both characters.The best part of this, as I mentioned, was the mythology. Ms. Feehan has created a wonderful concept here. The environmental message was laid on a little thick, but overall it was a good concept to quickly win the heart of the reader.Anyone who is familiar with Ms. Feehan's work will recognize this isn't her best work, but it is a fast read that opens a door to a series that has great potential for passion.",3,1

"Enjoyable, low key mystery. Plenty of murders but not too much violence (in the way they are handled). 60 year old, unemployed man, is caught  up in The Case of the Murdered Cheer Leaders. Along the way he comes into the orbit of one fellow high school student, from many years ago, who was still in the mood for love. He, himself, has also been warned that his efforts to help the remaining former students, will bring on him the same fate as was meted out to his female classmates. A warm, congenial book despite the grim subject matter, l found it quite pleasant. The hero is a good companion for the time it takes to read the story, so, too, is his  security guard buddy, and, even, most of the police on the case. The author writes well, the plot, though creaky is serviceable and the more relevant characters nicely sketched. I will happily now move on to other books by Moats.",4,1

"This story is extremely well-written, but it is best appreciated by adults who look beyond the surface and who are interested in the exploration of the metaphysical. What is reality and consciousness? Is there existence beyond the physical world? And can the physical and metaphysical world interact? If you cannot wrap your mind around these concepts, you will not appreciate this book. There is also a lot of symbolism throughout the book as reality overlaps with ""other"". It can be confusing, but I found it an enjoyable read. The ending isn't terribly clear cut, but I believe the author does that deliberately to leave it open to the reader's interpretation. The characters and world-as-we-see-it storyline are riveting and keep the reader engaged.",4,1
"I loved this book. Victor has one of the most fascinating voices I've met.He is not bothered by his flaws and moderately interested in what happens around him if he's not involved. Things and people almost happen to him. He is absorbed in himself and at the same time he doesn't take himself too seriously. His psychic powers are an annoyance and he would clearly get rid of them if he could. Although he's been trained to use them, it's clear he didn't pay much attention during his classes and people around him always seem to know more than him. He tries to turn down his psychic abilities popping drugs like candies, but he's never hiding himself and he doesn't seek for excuses. He is what he is.At the beginning I thought the unconscious way he attracts Jacob Marks, who is his exact opposite, elegant, smart, sexy, was impossible to understand and I felt the author owed us some sort of explanation. Now I know it's not necessary. Jacob falls for Victor like I fell for him as a reader: fast, hard, with no apparent reason.This is the first book of a great series. I give it only four stars out of frustration because it's too short!",4,1
"1.75 StarsThe one thing I can truly compliment on this one is the disclaimer expressing that this does not show an accurate presentation of BDSM relationships was a good move on the part of the author and probably kept some of the criticisms for some aspects of the story down to a minimum.This story turned out to not be my particular cup of tea sadly.  I had hopes for the concept of ""the Clan"" after reading the blurb, but it was never explained in a way that made it feel anything but vague and a little flat.  The repetition throughout kept taking me out of the story itself.  I just couldn't get over the feeling that this was not a full story ... but maybe more like the erotic middle of a longer work.MadGiles",2,0

"The story starts strong with a classic Noir set-up (woman walks into dive bar looking for her lost sister and gets a big dose of trouble), but doesn't proceed strongly from there.  The relationships between the characters are unclear.  Every character seems to be a stereotype of some sort.  The realism factor is missing.  The ending is unclear.  With a stronger editorial hand, the author could have had something here.  But it takes more than visits to dive bars, missing women in peril, and characters who live on the wrong side of the law to make a good Noir story.",2,0
"Left to die by her werewolf mates after they are convinced she betrayed them and killed their father, Heather survives against the odds, though without the men she loves more than life itself, her soul feels dead inside.Now Cael and Riyu have learned the truth, and realize their own terrible betrayal of their beautiful mate.  They will do anything to make it up to Heather and earn her forgiveness, but is it too late?  Has her trust in them been irrevocably broken?Leave it to Maya Banks to have me bawling my eyes out over the Christmas holiday.  With her holiday release, Love Me, Still, Ms. Banks tore my heart to shreds.  Between my past experience with this author's stories and the publisher's synopsis, I really should have expected as much, in hindsight.Never has Maya Banks' ability to instill empathy for her characters in the reader been more evident than in this story.  I felt everything that Heather felt.  I ached when she ached for the loss of her mates.  I sobbed when she cried over the hurt she saw in her mates' eyes when they believed she had betrayed them.  And when they returned to her, I felt the same joy Heather did at her return to the mates and the pack she so cherished.In the midst of all that raw emotion, it never occurred to me what the story didn't have.  It wasn't until later as I reminisced over the story that it struck me - this is the first Maya Banks title I have ever read that has no sex scene.  You read that right - none whatsoever.  And you know what?  As much as I have enjoyed this author's undeniable talent at crafting love scenes that would melt the paint off a car, I didn't even notice it wasn't there while I read the story.  It worked very well without it.  In fact, I would venture so far to say that if adding a sex scene to this story meant cutting any other part of the tale, I would absolutely not want it.  Love Me, Still was that perfect.  If anyone should doubt Maya Banks' writing talent, this story can be held up as a prime example of her ability to stir emotions without needing sex to do so.When I am in the mood for a good tearjerker with a beautiful love story featuring the reuniting of lovers, Love Me, Still will be the book I reach for time and again.**This story can also be found in the print anthologyThe Perfect Gift**",5,1

"For many years, Meli Galdes serves as her family's ""unofficial"" assassin, and she is a very good one at that. Her family's last assignment for her was to do away with Celino Carvanna, the man who has hurt her in the past.When Celino saw her, he didn't remember her from the awkward girl he knew from before. All he was aware of was being captivated by her, and he would do anything to possess her.I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend, and I'm glad I did.Though Ilona Andrews introduced a new world in this short read, the setting wasn't hard to understand, perhaps because it was patterned after the Mafia of our world, but it's more than that. The author gave just the right amount of description in order to help the readers understand the Kinsmen world, and she did it without info dumping or sounding tedious.I also like her characters, especially Meli who is the quintessential strong woman, and who rose from the ashes of her vulnerability and past pain without turning hard, enabling me to sympathize with her. I like that Meli didn't immediately fly into Celino's arms when he declared his feelings for her, as had happened in so many books I have read in the past. To the end, Meli was her own woman, forged in the fire of her experiences and the situations life--or people--has dealt her. I have long wanted to read a heroine who's strong like Meli and this story didn't disappoint. I was expecting a twist, but when it came, I was still caught by surprise. It was brilliant and oh-so-right for this story. Get this book, and you won't be sorry. Suffice it to say, I'm looking forward to more books in the Kinsmen world.",5,1

I like some books where the hero isn't all that great of a person, doesn't always do the right thing, doesn't do the things for the right reasons... but inside you know they are good at heart and doing the best they can. Steven R. Donaldson's &#34;Man Who&#34; mystery series being a prime example.This book, none of the folks you SHOULD care about are likable in any way. Z isn't someone you can like. The story drags on and on and on. I just wanted it to end. Z has his two old buddies from high school who help him out but none of them seem to like or respect each other and there's no real connection other than they knew each other back when they were high school football jocks.

"(I would give this story a 2.5 stars and not 2 if I could)To start, I'll give some background on the story. Undergrad Freshman Jada Mae Channinng and Grad Student Aaron McKensie starts a strong friendship while attending Harvard and volunteering at a local community center. On the last day of the fall semester, the two can't deny the lust that's been mingling between then for months and finally gives in. The two continues their friendship through the months ahead but with Aaron working for his father's company in Europe and Jada working here way through school, the two lose contact.Four years later in Atlanta at a dinner party, Aaron and Jada reconnect on terms that aren't so well inviting. Much has changed in four years. Aaron who is often cited in the ""Wall Street Journal"" is now branching out his business in Atlanta to work closely with NFL team the Atlanta Falcons, is his own multi-millionaire and is in another relationship. Jada is now working her way through Graduate school to become an Educator while holding down two jobs. And oh yeah, she's the mother of Aaron four year old son, Joshua.Determined to make up for lost time with his ""new"" family, Aaron does everything in his power to show Jada he's in love with her and wants to be apart of his son's life. But as it may, coming from two families with very different backgrounds is holding them back from what they both want, or at least it's holding back Jada. Aaron's father, Alexander is unwilling to accept that fact that Aaron is not only a father but is in love with a lower-middle class African American women. Jada Mae's grandmother Candace is reluctant about Aaron because of her own prejudices against White men.But Aaron is willing to walk away from everything including his father, current girlfriend and the company to be with Jada and Aaron exclusively and it's up to him to prove just that to Jada.My personal take:I've read 3 other stories by Savannah J Frierson, and of the 4, this one was the most disappointing. I felt like I've read this story several times from other authors. It was kinda ""cliche-ish"" to me which was what disappointed me the most. I can't say this was a romance novel because there wasn't many romantic moments in the story. There was one intimate scene and I felt like it was severely rushed. SEVERELY rushed!The character development could have been better. There was one instance where Jada was called ""fat"" by a counterpart yet, no where in the story was her size ever mentioned until after this incident took place besides when it was mentioned how short she was compared to Aaron who also wasn't described very well. The character Jada came across being extremely whinny and her best friend Deshae was highly nosy! I felt like Deshae fit this stereotypical African American women too well and that bother me to know end. Actually, it got on my nerve to say the least.What I did like about the story was how well their son Joshua was incorporated.He seemed like an adorable kid.I won't say you shouldn't read this book because we all have different tastes, but if you've read previous work by Savannah, you might not like this story as much as say, ""Trolling Nights"", which is the best books I've ever read. I had certain expectation from Savanna after reading other books from her and this one fell extremely short of those expectations. I was just overall disappointed.",2,0
"**4.5 stars**I am very very excited about this series. I love the character of Vic and the psycop world that Jordan Castillo Price created. This review won't be very long because I only have generalized gushy, lovey stuff to say about this series thus far. My main complaint is that I wish the book was longer. I could have used another 100 pages. I'm going to keep reading each book in the series because this first book just left me wanting more!",4,1
What a tedious book! I very nearly did not get through it. Long drawn out repetitive story that was not well written and very unimaginative. The villain was obvious from the beginning and the ending was poorly done. Terribly story.,2,0
"As an avid lover of fairytales revamped for adults, I literally devoured ""Mrs. Beast"" in one sitting. I began reading it around 10p.m. and I stayed up until about 2 a.m. It was that good. I loved how Elora had her finger in every fairytale ""pie"" and her interactions with her poor, mistreated mutt.The sequel starts out strong, but as soon as the protagonist, Rune (the daughter of Beauty and the Beast) goes on a quest to find the Hedgehog turned Prince that she is infatuated with, the story rapidly begins to lose steam. I think the problem is Ms. Ditchoff used and elaborated on the backstory of so many better known, more interesting fairytale characters all the well known, more interesting fairytale heroines in her first book, leaving her to really scrape for more to use in this one and the characters are, for lack of a better word, lame and completely one-dimensional. Or perhaps she was rushed when she wrote the sequel and was not able to take the same amount of time and care she put into the first to really expand upon her characters.I found myself unable to connect or really care about Rune or all the characters in the story the way I did when I read Mrs. Beast. Plus, the characters who share their tales are so unfamilar to me, that I felt kind of lost and my interest wanned.For example, Rune meets the Bog King's daughter who takes FOREVER to tell her boring story which could have been summed up in a paragraph. Basically this is her backstory: Mom is raped by the Bog King, daughter is born and turns into a 80lb frog each night(sounds like Fiona from Shrek...). Priest comes to village, then Bog daughter escapes to Egypt with Mom, turns back into a princess, then goes to Heaven with the Priest, returns to earth and finds that 100 years have passed, so now she is a bolt of lightening for all eternity that works for Elora. Um...yeah...okay...Elora is a lot more subdued in the story and her interactions with her mutt don't sizzle with the same humor and irony. I forced myself to continue reading, but it was unenjoyable and a big let down.Because of the strength of Mrs. Beast, I would be willing to give a third book by Ms. Ditchoff a try, but if it dissapoints me as much as Princess Beast, then I won't be purchasing anymore.",2,0
"This review contains a MASSIVE SPOILER that I wish I'd known before I read this book.You've been warned.I read this book b/c I was specifically seeking a story were the lead characters go snowed in.  I got exactly what I wanted.  What I did not want and what gave me a tight, ""I can't believe this, I know this can't be true"" feeling in my stomach that ruined most the book for me was SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER the heroine thought the hero was her half brother for most of the book.  She kissed him and allowed him to fondle her although she thought he was her half brother.  Due to some plot device, she woke up in his bed, and of course he was so glad to see a beautiful woman in his bed in the morning, that he proceeded accordingly.  She did not immediately leap from the bed in horror and dismay.  The touching and arousal (!) continued until it was going to go one way or the other and *then* she got up.  All the while thinking he was her half brother.  This happened within hours of her meeting him.  It is not the only instance of them making out and basically doing foreplay while she thought he was her brother.  Ugh.Basically, this book had an overlay of seeming incest, unbeknownst to him but known to her, for over half the book.  She struggled with it a little, but not really, imo.  Not enough to tell him the truth immediately.  Who does that? To say that I was skeeved out does not even begin to capture it.  I kept reading b/c ""there was just no way"" that they were really related.  Of course, they weren't, but that bad taste in my mouth never left completely.  I really thought less of the heroine for her lack of honesty.  If I'd known that about this issue, I'd have passed on this book.",1,0

When I downloaded this book I was expecting the usual Young Adult fantasy story.  And in fact it started off that way.  But I realized that the relatively slow pace of time through the book meant that the author was planning quite a long epic story. And I love epic fantasy books. So I enjoyed that this first book just barely started the story.  We lived through the childhood years in which Jahrra behaves rather like a typical child with all the immature decision making that goes along with it. However we begin to see the bigger picture little by little through the stories she's told. And we see signs of the person she's going to grow up to be. So many books these days try to cram far too much into a single book. I really like the fact that it's going to take a few of them to tell the whole story.  It's true that there isn't a whole lot of action in this book but there was plenty for me.  I immediately bought book 2 and read it upon finishing this one.,5,1
"I really enjoyed terrible entire story. I can only hope that I would act as intelligent and resourceful as these young people, if I were ever placed in the same circumstances",5,1
"I stayed up until 2 a.m. reading this book because I Had to know how it ended.  This is a great romantic suspense novel with some magic thrown in for good measure.  The characters are well-drawn and really do grab you.  Miranda's husband, Alexi, a lighthouse light keeper, has gone off to do a special and secret project for the Governor.  His letters stop coming.  So Miranda leaves her two sons in the care of neighbors and goes in search of her husband.  She only has one of her cats for company.  The story tells the story of her search and the unexpected resolution.This book is extremely well-written.  Great and memorable characters.  Excellent descriptions.  Very believable dialogue.  A fast moving plot with twists and turns.  It's just simply a fantastic  read!",5,1
Great tails that i can see being told before a king at a feast. I enjoyed the book and wish there was more to it.,4,1
"I've read my share of cozy mysteries, so I generally enjoy the genre.  I found this particular one to be unfulfilling, both from the standpoint of the mystery, and in its depiction of the characters.  Also, I would have appreciated it if it had been made clear in the blurb that this is Christian fiction - at least, I thought it so  since anytime the plot was starting to build up any hint of momentum, the two protagonists would stop and quote scripture at each other.  (If the Bible had copyright issues, this book would have lost pages in length.)The female protagonist earned her title of ""limp"" from me because she falls for a man based on the fact that he bears a surface resemblance to her imaginings of Lord Peter Wimsey, and she convinces herself it's a forever thing after a couple of strolls and a kiss.  There are sheltered thirteen-year-olds with more romantic sophistication than this.The male protagonist earns his ""limp"" status because he keeps proposing to the limp heroine, even after multiple rejections, yet doesn't actually do anything to present his case or win her over.  Probably this is intended to show his faithfulness and humility, but this is the kind of nice guy who finishes last in the real world.  And early on in the story, he responds to something the heroine tells him by saying ""Yes, mother.""  Not romantic.  Not sexy.  Not appealing.There are minimal formatting, spelling, or grammatical issues, but for me, in the absence of a genuinely intriguing mystery or engaging characters, this wasn't much of a redeeming feature.  I'm sure this book will be a pleasant read for some, just not for me.",2,0
"I love the writing in this one, the characters are good.  The clones are getting old.  And as I said in my review of Hallowed,  When is Jesus taking center stage,  He is the main reason we look to Christian authors for more,  We want Him glorified, not just His vessels.  Jesus needs more credit, and man less..",4,1
Not much more than a constant romp in the hay as they say.  A little less of that kind of filler of falling in and out of bed would be a good start on a better book.  Story not too bad when you get through the boring fluff of he did she did stuff.,3,1
I have thoroughly enjoyed meeting Dr. Thorndyke and following his experiments and deductions.  These stories were written a long time ago so some of the science which was new then is a bit outdated now.  This does not detract from the stories which have interesting plots and are a good read.  I recommend these books.Dr. R.L. Pendleton,5,1
"Sweet, very pleasant read.  I hadn't read a Harlequin for some time and had forgotten how enjoyable they are. You park your mind, forget your troubles and just enjoy!",3,1
"The first Hell Cop was incredibly enjoyable and something just that little bit different. In this 2nd book they're building on already established relationships and reading it was like visiting with old friends. God. I am such a sap. But it was just so good!Trust Me, by Astrid Amara, has Jay and Brian a year down the track. Jay still delights in being able to touch someone and Brian is growing into his own skin after the revelations' in the previous book. The growth of the characters relationship was beautifully done and the hook of Brian's lack of control was an engaging one. He begins to realize that his ability to touch Jay does not exclude him from being left and his need to learn to control his power, or risk loosing his lover, becomes paramount. A sexy, perceptively written story that does not just look at the surface of a relationship, but delves deeply into its workings.In Dark Waters, by Nicole Kimberling, the world building is tight and I like her attention to little things that make for vivid reading. The balance of power in a relationship, knowing when to listen and when to argue, brought a warmness to the story. Michael is such a professor and I like how out of his comfort zone he is with Argent at times, when he cannot use his mind reading powers. Parts were also surprisingly funny and had me laughing out loud. I think Bert's - a bunch of drunken goat-legged midgets and that poor, maligned turtle were rather amusing. hehe.Finally, in Such Heights by Ginn Hale, dark and broody Moran returns on another case with his blond and gorgeous journalist lover  James. Moran is still determined to resist till the last and I think there is nothing more satisfying than reading about this cop being brought to his knees. So to speak. O-o The floating palace was a very cool world with tentacle like spells and enslaved demons, which made for a cool backdrop for the characters.Freeloading, hippie mermaids, large bovine like creatures, pocket demons and castles that travel about in the air. These 3 authors write books that I want to read. Get it here from Loose Id. Also, check out Hell Cop 1 here.",4,1
"I'am not a literary critic and have a tough time spelling correctly, that said I give the author one star for  writing a book and a series.I'am a huge fan and avid reader of Military Space Opera with a strong Heroine's,  so I gave this work a try.  I was hooked enough to buy the last novel just to see how it ended, hence the second star. Am I bashing this work because I'am a prude or a religious do-gooder, ""NO""., but if the the sexual relations where deleted there wouldn't be much of a story left and what's left is not believeable at least to any-one with military experience or common sense.The facts: this series had a huge potential, the science isn't bad, and the main character loveable, many battle scenes well described, but five stars this work is not.",2,0

"I've read two books in the series and I don't think I will be reading any more.  The story was the same in each book, just different characters. The emotional connection really seemed to be lacking and I couldn't grasp how fast the female characters fell in love with their captors.  The stories seem to be running back to back in a timeline but the human females never interact even though their Cyborg captors do, albeit it sparingly.  I also didn't like how the characters from previous stories acquired their female slaves, fell in love with them, but had no problem giving another human female to their Cyborg friends as gifts.  It's as if the author is saying that even though the characters fall in love with humans the Cyborgs still consider humans to be no better than property.I think the concept of this story was too much for my preconceived notions to overcome.  When you say, &#34;Cyborg&#34;, I think Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator.  The whole human slave issue was also hard to come to terms with, as was the fact that the male character was gray.  This author's Mating Heat series is better, but there is still that underlying prejudice against humans that never seems to be resolved.  This left me a little deflated thinking that the female character is always going to be looked down upon by those around her.",2,0

"SPOILERS AHEAD......Basically this is the story of Troy who nine years prior cheated on his fianc&eacute;e Bree with her best friend Meg. When Meg turns out to be pregnant, he elopes with her and they marry. He only tells Bree after, and then only by phone. By sheer coincidence Bree was going to tell Troy she was pregnant herself. Instead she left town, but lost the baby at three months pregnant.Present day and Bree has returned home for her sisters wedding. Of course she runs into Troy. Who had lost Meg in a road traffic accident fours years before. But he berates Bree for not attending the funeral. After all both he and Meg had apologised.Troy never knew about Bree's pregnancy or miscarriage, she never told him.What a shambolic mess this story is. The reader is never shown anything that happened in the past. All we get are small remembered snippets of conversations. The main story that is set in the present is weak, very little happens. The characters are shallow and self absorbed. I found it very difficult to relate to them in any way. Nothing happens except Troy constantly blames Bree for leaving town, and he can't understand why Bree who was madly in love with him wouldn't want to hang round and watch him play happy ever after with her best friend. As for Bree she should have told him she was pregnant. It might have made this a more interesting tale. And just to top it all off, Bree's father tells her that when Meg got pregnant he was the one who told Troy to marry her. But then as her father was a cheater himself what else can you expect. With family like that who needs enemies.If I could have given this no stars I would have. First and last read for me by this author. Don't waste your money.",1,0
"I bought a Kindle 1 from my friend. It allows me to enjoy books and preiodicals again with its large print and clear e-ink. It frees me from reading large print only on the computer.I subscribe to USA Today's e-Edition. It looks like the printed paper. I can save it as a pdf and enlarge the print. The problems are: there is more information in each daily than I can absorb, and I'm stuck in front of a computer.I prefer the Kindle edition  of USA Today. It is more concise, thankfully. It's easy to navigate through articles and sections, and so is a quicker read.It would be nice if the publisher allowed downloading editions I might have missed.

"I`ve read one of the other books in this series and liked it. I like Alpha males as long as the women are strong too. And as long as there`s no rape. Being Alpha does not mean you have to rape women even if you`re stronger than them and want them.Unfortunately this had a heroine who was supposed to be strong but wasn`t at all. And there was rape. These are the two main things I have against this book.Casey was captured from Earth when she was trying to run away from an ex who wanted to rape her. Only to end up with a Zorn who not only kidnaps her but also treats her very poorly. He rapes her (and yes, it`s rape if someone says no even if she`s forced to orgasm) and is forgiven for that. I find it very disturbing that a woman who escapes rape ends up being raped - and that is portrayed as a good thing.There are probably some readers who can accept rape-turns-into-love, but for those of you who are like me - this is not a book for you!",1,0

"Mankind's Worst Fear by David L. EricksonThe story captured my attention and kept me up, reading late into the night. I find explaining where you are should be easy unless, it involves sending someone into the future, into the past and then back again. If not handled correctly it can become a real headache for both writer and reader. I feel that Mr. Erickson handle that tricky task with aplomb. A good read. It's also a look into a future we must avoid at all cost, no matter the cause, whether by human wars or, in this case, contact with aliens bent on the annihilation of the human race. Let's hope our exploration of Mars, sometime in the near future, doesn't result in the problems encountered here.",4,1

Detective Payse Halligan searches for her missing partner before a serial killer &#34;The Crucifying Angel&#34; gets to him first. A slow start but it picked up pretty quickly - like a killer who murders through reverse crucifixion! I must say that reading this book gave me chills. Though the subject matter is dark, it has a good plot but the character development needed some improvement. In saying that, it has action, suspense, and a lot of nail-biting moments. I really liked the main character Payse, who is a strong and smart. Overall a bit predictable but well worth a read.",3,1

"The story starts out with us finding the Avatar of the Almighty living i a small village that is burned by Mordred who is trying to prevent his on death told in a prophecy.  The boy and his sister escape and the boy goes through learning more about what he is becoming.As a fantasy story (even with obvious religious overtones), I enjoyed it just for the reading.  We have a very confused individual who is special and is becoming involved in momentous events.  The story flowed and never slowed down.  Would like to have seen the volume be a bit longer.  And it looks like the editing has been redone as I did not see those errors.Now, if one expects a bit more than fantasy reading, then there are a few nits/pics about this story and character that are mentioned in other reviews.  Since I am not looking for 'deeper meaning' in my SCI FI reading, I liked it and look forward to the other two episodes.",4,1

"I appreciated the sub themes in this Steele series:  smoking, high blood pressure, abuse, obesity,divorce. I gave it a three because of some of the primary themes. Kylie and Bas Steele for example. Kylie spends her whole life learning her Dads business, resents Bas coming in to help run it, then turns around and sells it two months after her dad dies when she realizes she loves Bas and wants to follow him back to Charlotte. Then Vanessa's reason for not trusting Cameron in the last book was weak at best. His job? Also didn't like the ending of Vanessa Steele's story. It went against the character buildup of Cameron being strong and the controller of his world for the story to end with him huddled in a basement waiting for a rescue.  He's a Texan!  I Would have preferred a rescue scene or one where Cameron hid her away then grabbed his shotgun (you don't live on a 10 acre ranch without one) made a cell call to his friends and then went out and took care of business in a Westmorelands/Madarises kind of way. This series is very corporate America. Needs a bit more rugged maleness and excitement.",3,1

"""Anvil of Tears"" starts slow but soon picks up the pace and turns into a fast paced story with good characterizations and a plot that is somewhat unique in its genre. It kept my interest well and I came to care about the protagonists.But, it does need editing and adverb removal would be a good idea. It is a little wordy at times and some of the descriptions would be better served by the ""less is more"" theory.Overall I recommend it for a good Sci-Fi novel that keeps the reader guessing and engaged.Karen Bryant Doering,Parents' Little Black BookMistBlueEeyore@gmail.com",4,1
"I just lost 6 hours of my life that perhaps would have been better spent repeatedly smacking my head into a brick wall or getting a rusty drill, anesthetic free root canal from Orin Scrivello. The first book was OK, the writing wasn't great but the story made it worth the continued read. This one, oh dear god. Raea spends the entire book vacillating between rhapsodising about Elis' eyes, hair, touch, smell etc, and having debates in her head about who is/may be/probably double crossing her. Elis spends the whole time, literally, in tears. It went something like this. This reminds me of Elis, oh I miss him, oh if only I had paid attention, oh I can't wait to feel his arms around me, oh if only I could have realised earlier that I love him. Rinse repeat. Over and over and over and....you get the point. And that wasn't the only bit of repetition, we get told the same exact thing again and again, seriously, I counted at least four places where the same paragraph imparts the same information, almost verbatim. And what is with this girl and slapping people in the face? She's a little slap happy. The only interesting thing about this book was that it introduced us to Inar'Ahben but only in the most basic sense.

"This is the story of a detective and his new partner encountering a murder case.  The case becomes something much more than solving a basic murder when details come to light regarding people related to murder victim.  And it becomes an issue of solving more than one case and adding assistance from FBI and Navy.  The premise, while not a new one, has merit.  The specifics are predictible in some parts and there are no real twists to getting to the ""who done it"" and why.  However, that does not mean that many will not enjoy this version.  For many will.  Fans of true suspense crime novels won't find real depth found in other noted authors of same genre (Robb, Grafton, Etc.) - but is a fairly good attempt.The issues lie with presentation (style) moreso than premise.  The novella is riddled with errors related to grammar, punctuation, character development and presence, Point of View, and story arc development.Punctuation:  overuse of exhuberance (!) where illfiting at times, extra floating dialogue quotes at end of paragraph without dialogue, other than dialogue bits (some, not all) incorrectly punctuated, some dialogue missing punctuation related to tags, missing or incorrect punctuation.  Dialogue paragraphs with same speaker punctuated incorrectly (though very few will know such.)Formatting is still a bit of an issue as there are some pages where paragraph breaks are so many only two small paragraphs fit on page.  I do not include format issues in star rating as I know that (at times) formatting is amazon conversion issue from downloaning - rather than writer issue.  However, it appears as if the manuscript was originally typed double spaced and when hitting double return between paragraph breaks (which would then be 4 lines, rather than customary 2) there was an overabundance of spaces.  If that is case a simple full document conversion to single spacing prior to downloading should clear up format issues like that.Grammar:  wrong words used - corn rolls (should be rows) to describe ME hair, make on (should be one) take - there are several such errors - but you get the idea on that.  Past tense and present tense switches in sentences and paragraphs was frequent.  Some may be stylistic choice of writer and happens - but not with such frequency as seen in the work.  Some subject/verbs were not grammatically correct - plural nouns get plural verbs,  etc.POV:  I origionally was going to forgive the first few POV switches as character related fleshing.  But, when the POV for many of the characters switched between third person and first person (in same paragraph) I realized it was author error, NOT character voice.  It is possible to have a character think to self in first while rest of tale told in third - but only if the writer understands the fine line and can convey properly.  In this installment of series (in author defense this is first in series and she may have worked this issue out in later works) the author has no grasp of what POV she is using and how to use properly.  One POV is best for the whole work until such time as skill is developed well enough that conveyance and reading are not stilted for reader.Character issues:  Trace was intergral character and partner in training,  then he just (all but) disappeared about half way through book in order for the ""love"" plot device to develop.  Bob was FBI partner that was there for a blink, disappeared for the same reason as Trace, then popped in near end without adding ANYTHING to storyline.  It would have served better to leave Bob out and just send 1 FBI agent to work case as Bob did nothing but add an inconsistency to story line (detail on that next) .  Press was well developed and Trace fairly so (even though underused)  as was female agent.Inconsistencies:Chapter 11 - Press and Trace left interview with Moira - they climbed in the beater car and drove away...fine, until the reader turns the page and Press puts key in ignition, turns it and gets the smoke plume.Chapter 27 - title states day 4 time:  10 AM - yet the first paragraph has press and agent arriving at house ""that evening.""Chapter 28 - title states day 5 at 9:15 AM - Bob tells Rachel he will be in that night and see her next morning.  However,  he does not show up until day 7, several chapters later.There were more issues related to each listed, but you get idea.  I apologize for length, I write long - though typically not thus much.  However, I viewed a comment by author wherein she stated that a review was not really fair to those reading it (or to her I surmise) without specifics so she could fix errors.  Though some of the word issues and punctuation are not a big deal and frequqntly missed - the gross errors (POV and story arc inconsistencies) should not require reviewer intervention for correction. They should have been caught by writer or her editor as they are glaring.As stated in beginning, many will enjoy this novella. Though predictible and even with errors it is an okay read.  If there were not so many errors, I would have awarded more stars.Christine",1,0

"Let's see first off this book was so bad I couldn't even get through it, I'm at 63% and I can't bring myself to waste anymore of my time on it. With that being said here's what I can tell you about what I have read--there's no character development, Ral all but rapes Ariel in the first chapter, he's not really a sexy leading man with his razor sharp teeth which kinda makes the ""love"" scene a little scary, he talks like a caveman but is some super strong intelligent alien race. Ariel, while I could see would be some frightened girl is pretty much a shell she has no personality and falls in love with this Alien who rapes her and finds she just loves having sex with him, here I can only say . . . wait . . . what? There's too many poorly written sex scene don't get me wrong I love a good romance and I appreciate well written love scenes but these were lack luster and seemed to come on every other page. Also once they make it to his home planet the author was not very creative, the world consist of three colors, I love red, purple and black but the whole planet in this three color palette is boring. She also seems to like the words snarl and growl they were used far too often, using the same words over and over again makes reading this book tedious. I got this book for free had I not and actually spent the way too high asking price I would have returned it when I hit the fifth page on my kindle. There are way too many good self-published authors out there to waste your time on this book.",1,0

After I read the kat Daniels books I decide to read all they wrote. I never got into the edge series but found what I was looking for in this book,5,1
"The book had 1764 locations on my kindle. The book was about a 26 year old woman, named Alicia and a 30 something year old man, named Adam. Alicia was very responsible and had been financially taking care of her mother and sister for several years.She was strong in some ways, but emotionally weak. Adam was very wealthy, handsome, jealous, ruthless and determined man. He also had trust issues, due to his past. He took, whatever, whomever he wanted and he wanted Alicia. She was accused of stealing money from his company and he blackmailed her into becoming his mistress.  The book contained very tame sex scenes, in my opinion, but overall this was a 4 four me. BUYER BEWARE, if you do not like a take charge, overbearing male. who makes every decision for the heroine, this is not the book for you.",4,1
"I have had this book for many months and I have attempted to read it several times. The problem I have is that the storyline is excellent, but the writing drags tremendously, in my opinion. I know that some people appreciate this ""full disclosure"" type of writing. I'm just not one of those people. I don't think it's necessary to know the look of the scene at every moment, or the clothes the characters are wearing, or other things that really don't pertain to the story, especially in a story that is supposed to be fast-paced. I understand bringing the characters and scenery to life, but I feel this book goes too far, and it loses me every time I try to read it. I can't recommend this book unless the person who is going to read it appreciates too much explanation (I say 'too much', but I agree that for some, it's not too much - this is strictly my opinion). To reiterate - the storyline is quite interesting and has kept me attempting to read it on several occasions. I just haven't been able to jump the ""too much detail"" hurdle. Maybe some day.",3,1

"This book started out as interesting but quickly descended to trash.  The hero, I guess, became unlikeable.  I guess the second main character was a woman deserting because of fear of death who was captured and turned into a cyborg.  Kindle is helpful because it tells you how much I read.  I read about 60% of the book which was a waste of time.  At price of .99, I didn't lose much.",1,0

"I wish I could give it zero stars. This might be the worst thing I have ever read. It is a very short story about a man that comes up with a bra that stimulates the breasts. It seems like something a 15 year old boy would write. This ""book"" was a freebie and I still feel ripped off.",1,0
"This was a pretty good short story.I found myself laughing and yelling at the book during different scenes. I love 'take charge, sexually aggressive men' and Milo is it. I couldn't help but wonder if Maya truly deserved him. I'm not going to give you a synopsis, but I will say that its the typical office romance where mis-communication causes people to act like fools. Although the story was mighty short, I was still entertained. And, the sex scenes were great. Who doesn't like those uninhibited, freeing, honest sexual experiences? Good god... I remember being reckless. LOL Anywayyy... it's a fun, fast read. So, for less than $2, you can't go wrong.",4,1

"The Dragon Knight series takes a short turn away from the main characters to tell the story of Lucia and Marcus. Lucia is a commoner who is working as a serving maid at a local tavern. Lucia has been trying to help a dragon (Sir Reynor) who is hurtand ill, but her skills are not up to the job. She finally goes to the castle to get help from a healer and is immediately involvedwith the dragon's knight Sir Marcus and his partner Sir Kaden, Reynor's mate.Lucia is a from the country of Helios, raised by the Jinn, she does not have a commoner background, she has a limited healing ability and is not afraid of dragons. Sir Marcus is totally captivated by her and his partner is also attracted in spite of his feelingsof guilt about Reynor's injury. The three can become a family, if Reynor can be healed and is able to fly again. Learning about Lucia's background and why she doesn't act the part of a serving maid becomes part of her attraction to the two knights.This story was listed as number 4.5 in the series and was only $2.66. I enjoyed this story and liked the character development,not sure if this shouldn't have been a regular book in the series, as it provides an intergral part of the plot. If you're reading the entire series, don't miss this book.",4,1

I do enjoy most Lena Matthews books...This short story kinda threw me with the menage couple and everyone being friends and hooking up. Which of course in any relationship you should be friends. I'm also tired of folks writing these books where the women are just over the top too...Why do the black women have to be so sassy? or attitudish...I'm a black women and of course a majority of my friends are black women and none of us are as extra and combative as some of these women in these books. I just wish how when I read books by my favorite black authors the heroines would be regular women not sterotypical stuff...But I digress the situation between Paige and Shane was lack of communication and I don't understand how she thought attempting to be with someone else was going to curb her feelings for Shane. It's a book to pass time if you need something to do. I think the price is high for it!,3,1
"This book was entertaining.  I enjoyed reading it but was disappointed with the abrupt ending.SPOILERSAva and Landon met, generated some fabulous heat and set the stage for overcoming the problem of Ava being the ""runt of the litter"".  Other minor characters are introduced that reinforce the lack of standing she has with the pride and put in place some politics that may need to be faced by Ava and/or Ava and Landon.But then they're solved by a simple declaration by Landon that she's his mate - huh???  Ava didn't really have to confront anyone, no one really offered an objection, yet all of the previous treatment of Ava would indicate that there should have been some of these problems to deal with.The author completely skipped the dealing with the issue to get to the happy ever after and just gave us the HEA leaving the issues supposedly solved but in my mind undealt with.The book had great potential, had the author stuck with the basic format of a romance novel and had our couple face and deal with their issues it would have been reached.  Instead it was an entertaining read but fell short leaving you wandering what happened.",3,1
"Briony Swift is a college math professor.  Her life is ordered and calculated and well, boring.  She flies the straight and narrow and can't remember the last time she did anything fun or risqu&eacute;.  Not the type of person to draw attention to herself, Briony knows that the hidden attraction she feels for two of her students is totally wrong and refuses to explore her feelings.  When the two men in question, Nic Potter and Leo Phelps, come to her office to get her to sign a form, all bets are off because once her name is on their drop/add slips, these two men are no longer her students.  And that scares Briony most of all.Two Plus One is a risqu&eacute; and rambunctious romp of erotic goodness.  Leo and Nic are naughty but nice and they are exactly what Briony needed in her life.  Briony needed them in her life and they were good for her as well as good to her.  The sex is hot, the love scenes emotional and the storyline engaging.  I really liked Two Plus One - other readers will as well.TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",5,1
"I picked up this paranormal romance quite some time ago when it was free. If formatting and grammar don't bother you, then you'll enjoy it. If it's a pet peeve, you might not be able to get beyond the first chapter.Femilla, the goddess of Womankind, has a duty to right grievious wrongs committed against women. As such, there are men in her keeping who are punished in the afterlife by the demon Demeana because they brutalized women when alive. Not all are beyond redemption, but must prove their rehabilitation. Andrew Regent is one of these men. After his death in 1509, he was tortured in the afterlife. But every one hundred years he has a chance. He returns to mortal life for a month. If he can find a woman to love who loves him in return, he will be saved. If he doesn't, he must withstand another hundred years of torture before he can try again. Many do not make it, give up and are consumed by the demon. It is now 2009 and Caitlin is his chance at salvation. As they get to know one another, Caitlin starts dreaming of the life of another woman, Catherine, the woman whose death caused Andrew to be condemned in the afterlife.This is a typical time travel/time slip romance which is fairly predictable. The characterization is excellent. The story, while a bit trite at times, is well constructed and dialogue is good. It is well plotted and consistent. But the formatting errors are crazy-making, so much so that I almost didn't finish the book. There are some grammar errors which also really distract, such as the Hero having ""chaffed"" ankles, and the Heroine feeling better after her morning ""adulations"". Oh, and Andrew is a ""genus"" with old weapons. I wonder what his species is?And this may seem minor, but glaring errors in covers really bug me. For instance, in the story Andrew is supposed to be blonde and the cover model obviously isn't. Yes, he's yummy, but it just doesn't fit. Additionally, you never put on bracers before putting on your shirt, unless you plan on fighting without one which frankly only happens in Conan movies and Frank Frazetta artwork.Before writing this, I checked the current publication date to see if maybe I just had an out of date download. But apparently that isn't the case and shows a lack of care and/or professionalism as several other reviewers have mentioned the grammar and formatting issues in the past. It's quite a shame, because this book could be a 3.5 or even 4 star work with just a bit more effort.",2,0
"I really shouldn't have enjoyed this as much as I did. I felt just a tad guilty. Anyway, I did enjoy it. I felt like it took them some time to understand each other and even then there were hurtles. I think they both allowed pasts to cloud what was happening to them which could have really been handled if they just talked to each other. Hunter was a jerk to start but I think we all get to place where once we begin to be hurt by the world we feel like it's better to hurt them before they hurt us. Lila was too damn sweet at first. I wanted her to have a life of her own. I was glad her father talked some sense into her. I enjoyed the story and would read it again.",4,1
"Prisoner 392 was a creepy, dark, disturbed story. The main character, Jakob, is extremely unlikable which makes his personal suffering bearable -- alsmot enjoyable. The author has a wonderfully descriptive writing style which I enjoyed. A good example was ""And silence dropped like a guillotine blade on a soft fleshy neck"".I give this story 4 stars, not because of the quality of writing. Oh no, the writing is superb and the story interesting. I lowered my rating because this was a short story. And I mean SHORT. So short, that on Page 1 of the story (after the cover, table of contents, etc.) my Kindle was registering 11% completed... I hadn't even started yet!! I paid 2.99 for it so I thought a should have gotten a little longer ""bang for my buck"".",4,1

"It was free, or I never would have even considered this book, just by the title and the little I knew about it.  I should have gone with my gut - if I wouldn't pay money for it, then why waste my time reading it?!?  There was barely a plot and it amazed me how ""into it"" she was. I mean, this guy was her new boss.  MAYBE I can let some of this slide and go along with that she was madly in love/lust with this guy and so she was up for anything with him.  But his friend, Wade??? Give me a break! Just the description of the guy made me want to gag, much less the things she did with him.This is truly a case of ""you get what you pay for"" and in my case I paid nothing.  For those of you who do actually spend money on this trash - know that it takes less than an hour to read it, so even if you do end up enjoying the book, think about how much you are willing to spend for an hours worth of ""entertainment"".",1,0
"I agree with some of the other reviewers of this book in that I believe the race card is played alittle too strongly.  I believe that unfortuantely, there still is racism in this country and I understand that is what the author was trying to convey.  My issue was mostly with the parts of the book where the author decided to add in the main character, Will Pruett, a young black reporter's, thoughts throughout the book.  We get that he is black but he is an educated man who does not speak like a 13 year old street person at any other point in the book so stop trying to make him think in a completely different tone of voice than he actually speaks.  It seemed the author was trying to ram down our throats that he was black by adding these thought bubbles in and it was completely distracting and unnecessary.  You can't make him 2 different people, he is either an educated man who happens to be black or he is the disgusting stereotype of an uneducated black man who cannot speak proper english, pick one.  Other than that, the second half of the story was really good.  I was interested in the story line and the second half definitely had a twist I was not necessarily expecting which I enjoyed.  It kept me hooked all the way to the end to find out how the story would be resolved.  Overall good book and good story line but there was just a lot of unnecessary stuff in the first half I could have done without.",3,1
I love this author her intimate details have you imagining some really incredible moments. This is a fun story about how if you think about the priorities in life you will work out the ones that really count.,4,1
"Starting out as a thriller this book slows down as it goes by seems to lose it's original voice.  By the 60% mark I was convinced there could not be a satisfying ending and that stayed with me right up until the unsatisfying ending.It really disappointed me because the book started out so strong.  The premise seems incredibly solid.  What would happen if the Virgin Mary's body was discovered.  Carrie,  Father Fitzpatrick,  Kesev, Emilio...  These are incredibly well written characters and the author begins this story building our interest in each if them with just enough information about them and their motivations to want to know more about them.  But again just past the half way point things begin to come apart.  Our once interesting characters seems to go one dimensional.  Carrie is no longer a complex woman she is more or less capable of focusing only on the Virgin.  Emilio turns into the standard hit man caricature and Fitzpatrick is now like a schoolboy when his girlfriend stops paying attention to him.By the end of the book we have the main characters meeting up with the underdeveloped ""bad guy,  right wing politician"",  the Virgin and apparently the hurricane manifestation of god.  Oh and god hates religion,  you know even the one his disciples founded and he is an enviromentalist too!The Afterward clears up some of the questions as to why the story began and probably why it unraveled but that of course does not make the book a good read.",3,1
"This was not what I expected.  The first 3 books are tales of Mary, the mother of Jesus that depict her as having miraculous abilities such as Jesus had. They are almost dublicates of each other purportedly written by different writers, maybe copies of an original.  They don't agree with the Gospels, which is why they are not part of the Bible.",1,0
"This book is an anomaly to me. The action scenes are good and believable, the bits in between have some merit but the whole thing put together lacks something...I really enjoy historical novels especially those ones that draw the reader in and immerse this person in the storyline by proving believability AND entertainment.  I suspect this is where this book fails.The initial training scenes read too much like a lot of modern military novels and, while I have little doubt that hazing existed in the 'day' I want to see something with which I can relate the historical value to, not, just a change in uniform.By far the most annoying part of this book (and the the bit that got me angry and probably spoilt the read) was the spacing between the lines.  If I pay a high (ish) price for a book one of the first things I look at is the number of pagers.  This book had 400 odd pages but with triple and sometimes quadruple spacing I paid good money for a lot of blank spaces. Stopping to be cranky at this spoils the immersion in the story and the experience.So - read the book and enjoyed the story but do not feel compelled to read any more in the series..",2,0
"I tried this book because I wanted something light and happy for this Christmas season.  I was very surprised to find it concerned an older hotel in San Francisco, one of my most favorite cities.  The heroine was a strong woman and she meets a man who is instantly attracted to her.  She is a little klutzy but all sorts of fun.  Personally, I can relate to that. I read this book I one short evening and think you'd enjoy this romance too.  If nothing else, it is a little different from the usual Contemporary Romance.  Happy Reading!",3,1

Disturbing is how I felt about this nook. Very graphic and extremely demeaning to women. I get the submission stuff but this is way over the top. I stopped reading several times and was not going to finish the book but then felt obligated since I paid for it. Certainly different than what I have read from this author previously.,3,1

The beginning of the was good, I was getting into the story but for me personally I wanted more romance, the adventure the mood, the scenery describe was good but that in-depth romance between Dan and Selena I didn't feel it. In the beingning Dan was mysterious and strong but I guess the world that they were living in would leave one void of emotions at times. So again for me all in all good read but felt disappointed with the romance.Still a Good job to the author to her debut book and still look forward for more to come.",3,1
"I really enjoyed this story with the unique concept, twists, and turns!I found the lack of abbreviations to make the reading a little too proper-- if that's possible, however, it did not detract from my enjoyment of the story!

"This is one of those books where even when you download the sample, you can still be led astray.  Shannon Stacey is capable of writing funny dialogue and the book gets off to a good start.  Unfortunately for all, this roadtrip runs out of gas very quickly.I`m not sure I have ever a novel with two such pathetic adult lead characters.  Ethan has moved to a new town because his MOTHER got a job there.  Unlike his mother, Ethan has no job.  We learn that his furniture restoration business was ruined by his ex-wife who fled with all the money.  Somehow this grown man was unable to take any sort of legal action and felt fortunate to still have a car.  What?  It gets worse as he is booked on a senior`s trip to Disney World along with his mother.Jill is a children`s librarian who seems to have big dreams that she does nothing to work toward.  Her family mocks her by saying, ""When the going gets tough, Jill gets going.""  Based on her track record this seems pretty accurate.The connection between the two characters seems more juvenile than believable.  Our hero can`t even say the word condom without blushing yet morphs into wanting anal sex in the last few pages.  Had the book stayed in the P.G. world, maybe the innocence would have made sense, but the change in Ethan`s behavior just doesn`t work.  Similarly, in a brilliant Dr. Phil type deduction, Ethan blames Jill`s lack of gumption on her family who have destroyed her self-esteem by telling her the truth.It appears that the two of them will limp along bankrolled by Ethan`s mom, who luckily meets a new man more interesting than her son.Toss in a police chief with narcolepsy and you have a story that makes you want to yell GAK!",2,0
The protagonist in this story is a very clever fellow indeed. Only Frank Herbert writes such cerebral short stories.I recommend this short story.,5,1

"Werewolf Dylan Gerrano knows his place in the pack, and it is not at the top. After helping his friends Abby and Brynn escape their ruthless alpha, Alan Matthews, they found themselves at the sanctuary of Red Rock. Here they have a new, kinder alpha and a place where they can start to call home. Dylan lived under violent conditions for ten long years, and collected many internal scars. Dylan is not an alpha, but that doesn't mean he isn't deadly. In the previous book, Sanctuary Lost, he killed Alan Matthews, and does not have one bit of regret.New to the sanctuary is Sasha Wallace. Sasha is a witch, who Alan Matthews had, and she escaped after Dylan killed him. Sasha's experience with werewolves has been anything but pleasant, and it is taking her awhile to adjust to the volatile emotions wolves can throw off. On top of that, wolves don't trust witches, and the tension in town is quite high with lots of evil stares her way.When a wolf is found with vampire bites, the town is stumped as to how to help cure her. Dylan and Sasha are fond of research and take to the books to see if they can help come up with a cure. As they spend time together, an attraction starts to build. Sasha worries Dylan's attraction is based solely on his wolf wanting to protect and heal, but after a few steamy kisses, Sasha is convinced it may be the real thing building between them. When their alpha sends them on a road trip to talk to a vampire friend of the pack, Sasha and Dylan spend quality time together and their bond cements.Sanctuary's Price is the third book in Moira Roger's Red Rock Pass series and this time the testosterone is taken down a bit. The first two books present very alpha wolves, but Dylan is quite submissive. But don't let that fool you. One of my favorite things about werewolf paranormal books is the politics and hierarchy of a wolf pack. Dylan is lower because he is submissive, but at Red Rock that doesn't mean he isn't respected. And when it comes to protecting the one he loves, he can fight as well as any alpha. He may not be constantly sneering, and growling if someone looks at his female the wrong way, but he has the ""mine"" concept down quite well.Dylan and Sasha have a very sweet romance going on in this book and it made me smile to read about them. They are both such good natured people, that have had to overcome much in their life to find happiness. You root for these two to finally find each other and experience joy. For as mild mannered they be in public, they have sparks flying in the bedroom.The female I loved in this book more than Sasha is Brynn, who is the heroine from the second book. Brynn was changed into a wolf during the full moon in book two and her wolf is extremely close to the surface at all times. She can almost be considered feral and is such an interesting character to read about. She is totally out of control and I love that she has already had her book, but still has so much yet to go through. She didn't get a ton of page time or overpower the romance between Dylan and Sasha, but she is definitely intriguing.This is the fifth book overall that I have read by Moira Rogers and I have to tell you that I have yet to be disappointed. I love their style of writing - they are sarcastic, funny, the sex is always hot, the action is always violent and their continuation of the stories and world building really stands out. The next book in this series, Sanctuary Unbound is out June first, and features a character we meet briefly in this book - Adam, a flannel wearing lumberjack vampire, who is going to be very fun to read about.",4,1
"This book caught my attention because the ""caper"" movie genre is one of my favorites. I love plots/storylines where individuals or a group of con artists/theives plan and pull off a good scam or heist. Back in the 80's, I did come across a few books with those kind of themes/plots, including a few with a female main character, but since then, they seem rather uncommon. I was happy to find and purchase this book as soon as I saw the the book description.I enjoyed reading Catch an Honest Thief. I liked the storyline, it held my attention, and it was a fast read. It's rare to find a book with light elements of planning/stealing, mystery/suspense, romance, future technology, and humor all wrapped together, and without being ""heavy"" and having to absorb too many meticulous, complicated details or boring, erroneous descriptions. It was different (in a good way), everything flowed together very well, and it was a nice ""escape."" I recommend this book as an interesting, lighthearted, clean, quick, and fun read. I would love to read about any future adventures Alexia (and some of the other characters in this book have) if the author decides to write more Haven mysteries.",4,1
"I love Frank Herbert's books, so this was an interesting peek into the writer as an ""embryo."" This reads like classic pulp Sci-Fi, but you can see the writer-to-come in some of the passages. It's too short, it's the kind of stuff you read in ""Analog"", it needs more fleshing out, but the themes of later Herbert books are twinkling in the darkness. It was free, it was interesting. It wasn't great.",3,1

This is my 3rd book I read by Brenda Jackson. It really was a good book to read. It took me a week & a few days to finish it.

"When I first got my Kindle, one of the first things I did was take advantage of the 30 trial and subscribe to the NYT. At that time I think the monthly rate was either 11 something or 13 something. The novelty of it was great at first. Seriously, the only thing that makes a person feel spoiled about waking is a newspaper delivered right to your bedside is a butler and breakfast in bed, or so I imagine. It didn't particularly bother me about the features missing because the price was good and the convenience was amazing. In the middle of nowhere, it was feasible to get most, if not all, of the news that's fit to print. Good deal.The paper is usually a delight, but here's where the practical came in. I ended up falling into a pattern of not reading it every day, and what was initially perfectly fine. The subscription was a bargain. The paper was there on the days I wanted it. When they announced the subscription hike, I knew it wasn't for me, because it made it feel wasteful, it made me feel guilty to think of not reading it daily. Once something I read in my leisure time feels like an obligation... In my case, and your needs might be quite different, the folks at the paper priced it right off my Kindle -- except by invitation.There are still periodicals I do subscribe to, like Time and Newsweek, blogs like Slate, and  a few others where the prices are in a range that I don't feel horrible if I skip an issue. With newspapers, however, I prefer to buy a single issue when I feel like it or if there's an event I see as historical. Sunday usually has me buying 3-4 papers to read over breakfast and throughout the day. (NYT, of course,  The Sunday NYT is heaven; my hometown paper, The Detroit Free Press; The San Francisco Chronicle; and often the Boston Globe. I feel more spoiled than ever now, because I'm taking advantage of having the papers *I* want, when I want them, without getting the editions I don't want, and it takes 2 minutes to select and receive them. When I hear of a good article on a day when I haven't purchased, it's usually found online.My recommendation is to get the trial and see what you think. See if you read it daily. See if it feels like a bargain. The beauty of the Kindle format is the convenience and so it only matters what method works for you -- subscription or my method of buying as needed.The NYT is 4 or 5 stars on the days I read it, but too expensive for me to maintain a subscription and allow issues to remain unread, so I'm giving it 3 stars overall since most people are probably reading this with subscribing in mind and strongly suggesting potential subscribers take advantage of the trial period.",3,1

Badly formatted and some grammatical errors towards the end. disliked the jarring pov and setting changes... the characterization was very weak and boring.,2,0
"Calling ""Tabloid Star"" silly is an understatement. There's nothing even remotely believable in the novel. A wasn't expecting a complex plot, but a story needs better than characters drawn by crayon to be readable.",2,0
"This story was ok. The idea is cute but not much thought put into it. There was no real dilemma between the 2 main characters. No huge fight. No psycho ex(even the boys biological was tame). No life threatening circumstance.  The dialogue had me scratching my head a lot. But I was able to keep up. It needs to be edited b/c of the grammatical, spelling, punctuation(or lack thereof), and left out words.",1,0
"Loved this book, I am hooked on this series and hope there is more! Kelsey Maxwell really made these characters so I couldn't get enough.",5,1
This story annoyed me from page one. it got 2 stars instead of 1 because the grammar was decent. the sex scenes were stupid and boring and the plot was idiotic. don't waste your money.,2,0
"I do agree that I would like to have spent more time with these characters. I was very bummed when it just ended, and i do agree it could have used more depth. But I really loved these characters. For what they were, in the length given, they popped. Book reads very much like a brilliant fantasy. Like all her stories so far, the story has a sweet quality to it, but very hot. I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was and look forward to more from this author.",4,1
Pretty nice little set of chargers for a good price.  I like to have an extra charger for my devices and this fits the bill nicely.,4,1
This book was so down to earth that I could not put it down until I read the last words.,3,1
The story wasn't long enough. There was no real background on the characters. It basically just jumped to the point and moved from there. Basically a man and a woman are manipulated to the alter by their respective brothers even though the author never explains how that came about. They basically go about there business trying to find common ground and respect for one another. Then out of nowhere his brother and her brother decide they are gay and want to fake their deaths and runaway together and bonus the happy couple is happy to help them in their shenanigans.,2,0
"It was so hard to keep reading after the first bit, which was probably the best bit. It just... Failed beyond words. It became boring, and I found it ridiculously stereotyped with the werewolves. If you are in love with werewolves like I am, prepare to scoff at the cave tunnel things. Ugh!",1,0
"Parts of the set-up here were really interesting.  They were even more interesting when they were on BBC's Merlin.  I mean, you kept the slash dragon.  Really?  King Ungor?  If you're going to file the serial numbers off your fanfic, file a little harder.",1,0
"Jules Verne's Guide to Survival. I enjoyed the adventure. This is one classic you don't want to miss. Not only is it fun to read, but you might learn something as well. The next time I read it, and I fully intend to read this book again, I'm going to keep my laptop at my elbow so I can find pictures of some of the animals and plants mentioned. I'd especially like to know if their ""horses"" are real or make-believe.",5,1
"I liked the story part and the erotica part a little better than Ral's Woman. However it was not rape as someone stayed. It was him tying her down so he could seduce her and have his way with her until he got is way. There was a little more of that then I would have liked to read about. I also got sick of Casey being immature. She kept whining and saying he lied and cheated when he did not. She was being unreasonable about the whole thing. That really turned me off the book more than anything. It's no wonder he had to tie her down. Another good, but not great read. So far I like Jaid Black's Trek Mi Q'an series and Evangeline Anderson Kindred Brides better.",3,1
"Gabby moved out of her apartment and away from her roommate and best friend Justin.  They kissed one night and she decided that she needed to get away from him before anything else happened.  And before she falls in love with him.  Justin has no idea why Gabby just up and moved out while he was out of town.  He's determined to find out the truth and realizes his true feelings as well.The book was okay.  I didn't get done reading it and hate it, but there's just wasn't that moment where I thought, that was a really good book.  It's cute and might be worth a read, but wasn't one that I'll read over and over.",3,1
Much to short but i loved it.  The book told a great story and it made perfect sense.  Loved learning about the pride and all the people that make it up,5,1
"Perhaps if the Accidental Countess had a different heroine, I might have liked this book.  The story line was interesting and the hero was imminently likable.When Stephen Chesterfield, the Earl of Whitmore awakens he is finds himself injured, with no memories of the last few months and married to his childhood sweetheart, Emily.  He is frankly stunned and disbelieving that they are married as he has no memory of their wedding.Emily has not seen her husband in months, he left very soon after their wedding and she is holding a major grudge and accuses him of all kinds of misdeeds.  She seems to truly dislike her husband and it is apparent to the reader she wants Stephen to remain her husband so he can protect and provide for her and her deceased brother&#8217;s children.Stephen&#8217;s memory does not return easily and Emily seems to resent him for it.  She is irrationally angry that Stephen cannot remember their wedding night.  This is just plainly ridiculous.  She is quick to believe the very worst about him.Stephen sets out to discover the missing pieces of his memory and it becomes apparent that someone wants him dead.  Even when the first attempt is made on his life, Emily displays little reaction.  I found her to be unemotional with Stephen unless she was angry.Later she begins to thaw toward the hero, but her earlier action and her inability to trust the hero had already cemented my view of her as an illogical (she never made any inquiries to her husband&#8217;s whereabouts while he was gone for months), self-serving heroine.",2,0
"I normally don't write reviews, but it personally ticks me off that this story is rated 3+ stars, which is the only reason I downloaded it. This is a complete and utter waste of time and energy. The ""short story"" reads like a back jacket synopsis to a promising book. That's it. There is completely no insight to anything. There is no past, a lunch time banter for the present and no future. The characters have no real identities. I don't know how this even takes 30 minutes to read. The story itself takes place in about a 30 minute time frame. It's useless.It's great that there is a plethora of free books available, but that doesn't mean I ought to be grateful for ANYTHING that is free.",1,0
"And this was the third and probably last book I have read by this writer.  I have to disagree with another reviewer that it was an unusual story unfortunately. It was definitely well written, but I would call it extremely typical and annoyingly repetitive story for this writer.Once again the romance revolves around the extreme growth of one character and another character going down a few inches. Once again the character who is growing obsesses over the smaller character and once again smaller character is oblivious as to how charming and charismatic he is that everybody wants him.This writer certainly knows how to write and how to write well, but based on the three books from her that I have read in rather short period of time (I usually tend to seek more books from this writer if I loved one book so it is nothing unusual) I find myself quite bored.",3,1
"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi, and you like erotic, then this book is for you.  Plus, the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story.",5,1
This one was just OK for me.  I found the thought of humans being served up for food a little hard to read about.,3,1
"Short, sexy story about ""straight"" college roommates discovering they might not be so straight after all. This is a fun Gay For You fantasy about what might happen if two male friends pushed their sexual boundaries. Nobody writes apprehensive sexual tension better than Evangeline Anderson. And come on -- who can resist a book that involves a game called ""gay chicken""?",4,1
"Ok, this is not a slap at the writer's skill or plotting.  I just found all the graphic violence against women disturbing.  I got the book because I was interested in how the author would describe cults (it was informative) and found the idea that a cult leader might have ""special"" powers to be a twist on the story that might be interesting.  However, I could not finish the book, it was just too creepy - instead of looking forward to the next plot development I just felt dread at what awful thing was going to happen, probably to some woman, next.  So - for those of you looking for light entertainment, or with a distaste, like mine, for repeated detailed description of sexual exploitation and violence - this is not a book for you.  Just saying.... Those with stronger stomachs, enjoy.",1,0
I tried this book on a free basis. It just did not suite my style of reading. It is worth a quick read.,2,0
I had no idea that this was a series but each time I discover the next installment I'm giddy with anticipation. The books have the right blend of angst and sizzle. Enjoy!,4,1
i picked this novella up for free.  really enjoyed it.  going to look for more of this author's work. loved the characters and the fast pace of the story.,4,1
"This is the last book I read in this series. While it's hard to follow after Ral's Woman, creating a buffoon-ish hero and a whiner female is not not a winning formula for a story. I was barely able to get through the entire book, hoping in vain it would get better. Sadly, it's a disappointment from beginning to end.",1,0
"After the first three books, which sizzled in plot and the erotic love scenes, this book was quite tame. It was short and brought closure to the series. I gave it 3 stars because the bar was set so high with the first three books which were 5 stars, that I expected more from this book. The book was good not great, but at least I'm not expecting another book in this series.",3,1
I think this could have been a much better and longer story if the author had just put a little more time into it. I did not like how it ended.,3,1
"Excellent Read - this short story is definitely a very sweet romance and it is also in the Into the Dark trilogy. Putting abused past lives  aside, vampires and Amazon Warriors can find some happiness and work together.  Perfect story and I just wanted to know more in the end.",5,1
"First a Greek Grandmother would have taught her grandchildren some of the Greek language.  For me the story was not believable.  It was a cute story but certainly not worth reading another of this authors books, unless the author can make her stories more real life.  If you read this one in a light hearted way it will be entertaining.",3,1
"The opening line caught me and conceptually the author offers a different take on the existence of vampires.  The execution  was what I consider respectable. However  I found Savannah (main girl's) internal chatter annoying, adding up to my enjoyment of the book only lasting 35% of the way through through the story and I just couldn't finish it.  Not even jumping to the end made me want to go back and fill in the story.The author considers himself a romance writer and the word romance in the book world is  broad.  I would say that the author was aiming for a romantic comedy - and if not oops because I couldn't take the scenario with any sense of drama (or danger). Readers of the Queen Betsy novels (of which I have only ever read a short novella) might enjoy the book as the humor is similar.",2,0
"I wish I could give half stars. If so, I would give this 3 1/2 stars, but I can't so I will be nice and give it 4. It's not a bad book for the price (I got mine for $0.99). I will say that the editing was simply atrocious, but if you can get around that, it is a quick read. The characters are likeable and the story moves along pretty quickly. However, there were a few parts that I felt were too contrived and not overly believable to actually happen in real life. BUT, the love scenes were HOT and steamy, very well done. I finished this in a day, so go ahead and read this if you are a fan of the author (which I am) and are interested in escaping reality for a few hours.",4,1
The author is just a bad writer. The action was contrived and the characters were flat. The dialogue lacked imagination so that the work was just one dimensional  and unbelievable.,1,0
It was a great book and I was impressed.  A creative perspective on the way the other side thinks while still continuing a good story. A real page turner and I couldn't put it down.  Si bueno as Juan would say,5,1
"This is only the second review I've ever written regarding a book I have not finished. Normally I don't feel I should rate something I have not been able to read from start to finish. I have to feel very strongly about an unfinished book to post an opinion about it.It was a very interesting premise, which is what prompted me to pick it up. I'm an animal person myself, have always wished I could communicate with animals and the plot sounded interesting.I got a third of the way through the book. Very little plot apparent even at that point, unfortunately. However, what absolutely turned me off this book was the rampant pro-PETA/HSUS agenda that was, as far as I could tell from reading as far as I did, the main objective of the author and the reason for the book. Not the story, anyway.The rescue of the sled dogs abandoned by dog sled racing people was bad. The description of lab animals when the main character was a child and her step father arbitrarily took her pet rabbit to be a lab test animal even worse. But what really capped it for me is when there was a long description of the 'memory' of the life of a commercially-raised chicken triggered by the main character taking a bite of cooked chicken. That was the last straw for me.I realize everyone has their own ideas about things but 'message' is one thing and trying to stuff something down by throat, calling it entertainment is something else entirely.Members of PETA or HSUS may get by these things without a problem. There may be a plot in the last 2/3 of the book that I didn't get to. However, like the main character being unable to swallow the bite of chicken, I couldn't stomach reading any more of the book.",1,0
"""The Barsoom Series"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs:""The Princess of Mars"" is story I in a V book collection. It is magnificent and captivating, and it's apparent from the first chapter that Edgar Rice Burroughs is a genius. This is a wonderful story filled with his spectacular thoughts and imagination. Original, epic, and enthralling, I was unable to put it down and am chomping at the bit to read the next four books in the collection. A true master of the sci/fi adventure genre on par with Vance and Wells......""The Gods of Mars"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The hectic, chaotic, frenetic, pace continues as John Carter, his son Carthoris, and Tars Tarkas take on the Issus and the ""the blacks"" to rescue Dejah Thoris (Princess of Helium). Massive battles and unrelenting treachery and deceit continues to fuel the fusilade of destruction on the enemy air fleets. Pulp sci/fi adventure at its best makes this one of the most entertaining stories of all time from the pen of a master storyteller......""The Warlord of Mars"" saga and action continues unabated in the third book in the Barsoom Series and it's fantastic! Almost constant conflict confronts John Carter, Prince of Helium, as he fights for the release of his beloved Dejah Thoris. The budding love between their son Carthoris and Thuvia of Ptarth brings joy to both houses. Edge of your seat battles against the Lord of the Thenes, Matai Shang, and his minion Thurid will keep you awake at nights as the Jed's come together and unite under the Jedakk of Jedakaks, the Warlord of Barsoom!......""Thuvia, Maid of Mars""carries on and expands this epic collection of stories. Book IV of the series shifts the focus away from John Carter to his son Carthoris and Thuvia, the love of his life. Enduring many hardships and death defying battles and contraptions Carthoris rescues Thuvia and receives the blessing from Kulan Tith, her designated husband, to marry her in his stead. Although a bit repetitive with events/confrontations similar to the previous books this is never-the-less a thrilling roller coaster ride that will exhilarate and enthrall you throughout...onward to the V and final book in the collection......""The Chessmen of Mars"" is my least favorite book in ""The Barsoom Series."" I loved the pacing and one of the most original and imaginative creature/humanoid/ creations in all of science fiction ""Ghek the Kaldane from Bantoom."" Kaldane's are unquestionably one of the most unusual, unique, creepy, entertaining yet unsettling, beings ever conjured by an inditer in the sci/fi genre...a simply wonderful and amazing creature! Once again the story shifts from Carthoris and Thuvia to the new heroine ""Tara, Princess of Helium"" and her suitor """"Gahan, Jeddak of Gatholian."" I love this series in spite of its predictability and occasional redundancy. A true classic with A movie in the works!",5,1

"This book is full of gems like this sentence. Had is used incorrectly so much that I started to read it out loud because it's funnier that way. If you are a teacher or an editor I believe this book will drive you insane. The story is very interesting.

Everyone takes a shot when you come across the word 'had' used incorrectly. I warn you, do this with people you don't mind sleeping over at your place cause no one will be fit to drive after the second page.For those of you that didn't see what was wrong with the sentence used in the title of my review please find all your English teachers and slap them.He had smiled back his eyebrow lifting. = He smiled back as his eyebrow lifted. or His eyebrow lifted and he smiled back.

"This book was supposed to be a &#34;thriller&#34;.  I do not call the murder of a beloved pet thrilling.  I call it depressing even in fiction.  This happened about a fourth of the way into this book.  As I make it a point to avoid this sort of writing, this is when I stopped reading.  Up until then, the book was fairly interesting.  However, I won't finish it nor will I read any others by Mr. Giles",1,0
"This was on okay read, not horrible, but not exhilarating either. The story is basically about mental illness and the stigma attached to that in the United States. It was well written in the sense of being able to understand the author's point, but not in the sense of a highly entertaining read. Argus, the main character, was memorable in his attempt to uncover the truth of his ordeal, while at the same time fighting his personal demons. I did like his character very much throughout the entire book. Sarah, Argus's wife, was pretty shallow in my estimation, considering she knew of his mental disorder when they married. The villain, when revealed in the end, was more of a let down given they had no more sinister reason than making a public statement basically in an extreme fashion. Again, it was a pleasant read, but would not be on my list of top 20 for the year.",3,1

"Alex Faustin knows who is destined wife is; now he just has to convince her she's his one.Alex is the youngest brother in the Faustin family - an old and respected Russian vampyr line. Alex's mother and father still adhere to the Old Ways, including the absolute belief in dream premonitions of their son's future wives. Alex is the first Faustian to be fated with a wife . . . the only thing is she lives in Colorado and will take a little convincing (of Alex's love for her, their bond and the truth about vampires).It's true; there are some bad vampire love stories out there. But Evie Byrne's first book in the `Faustin Brothers' trilogy isn't one of them. To be honest, `Called by Blood' isn't reinventing the fang - there's a mortal love interest, a rich and powerful vampiric family and a lot of smexing going on. But Byrne's series is oddly delightful, regardless of the well-trod territory.One of the great things about this book is Byrne's tongue-in-cheek humour. Alex Faustin lives in modern-day New York and his `mate' is Helena, a modern woman. These people know about vampires - the movies, myths and romantic ridiculousness - and as a result, Byrne draws on many references and pokes fun at many a legend. I liked her vampiric brevity - it was refreshing, without denouncing all the typical vampire/mortal problems.This novel is very sexy, first and foremost. It's from Samhain Publishing - a notoriously hot publisher. But `Called by Blood' has a surprisingly veering plot; when the rich and handsome Alex is burnt by the sun and spends a portion of the book resembling Freddy Krueger. That's right, a vampire love story in which the smoking-hot dead dude looks nasty and blistered for much of the book. It means that Alex and Helena have to connect on a personal level before a physical one . . . but when they do get physical, Byrne brings the goods (while still keeping things light and funny).My one small complaint about the book was the abrupt ending - I really would have liked another 100 pages or so. Since this is the `Faustin Brothers' trilogy it would have been nice to meet all of the Faustin brothers and get a sense of the family dynamic (as it is, we only meet oldest brother, Mikhail). And with an extra 100 pages we may have been able to read about Helena assimilating to vampirism and New York. But that's a small and complimentary complaint about wanting more, more, more from Evie Byrne's wonderful novel!",4,1
"The Remnants: Stories of the Jewish Resistance.By Othneil J. SeidenI loved this book! I wasn't sure what to expect when I got it, but upon reading the forward I was prepared for a wonderful historical novel. What I got was even better! I got a novel that was so based in fact and true stories that almost every encounter, every event, could be looked up and backed by historical fact. I did.I love a book that takes me so deep in the history of an event and makes it all so real that it sends me into research mode to verify things and learn more. This book did this in spades. What should have been a day or two read, turned into almost a week because I had to keep stopping and looking things up; I have over two pages of notes on events and people and rumors that I had to chase down. And Mr. Seiden never disappointed me, every part was true, from the Trench at Babi Yar, to the constant gun fire going on there by the Nazi's once they invaded Kiev. The fact that Soviet held countries, the Jews in particular, welcomed the German's as liberators from the prejudice, suppressive Communist party, only to find themselves in worse shape than they were before. The small bands of resistance fighters, turning into larger bands, the woods of Russia and the Russian weather providing the native fighters hiding places and advantages over the better equip German army. The pain of the bands too far away to heed the calls from the Warsaw Ghetto when they had their uprising Passover of 1943, and with each call they knew that no one was going to help them, not the closer resistance groups, not the allies, no one went the aid of these people that fought for over a month with no back up.The mob mentality of the people, turning on their neighbor's wasn't a surprise to me, having learned all this from a historical view point growing up more than 40 years after the fact, but in this author's writing I can see that it wasn't a surprise to him either, or his characters he writes about, having been pushed to the background, into slums, ignored by their government and spit up on by their peers over time, they expected it. The Pogrom's that the Church organized and the Government looked the other way during which they went in and massacred as many Jews as they could for centuries. What surprised them was the way the supposedly civilized German people treated them. The dislike and distrust of the Vatican and the Catholics in general, the people of the time had came through loud and clear in this work, but what came through also was the belief that people could go against what they had been taught all their life. By accepting some Genitals into their group, and trusting the fledgling groups location and plans to the couple that saved Solomon, and the Priest that spoke against the killings, and later sent Jews to them, and eventually joined them; yes, Mr. Seiden was able see all sides of the fallible humans that got caught in Hitler's quest for power and world domination.I give this book a rating of five solid stars, and am recommending it to any of my friends that have any type of interest in this area of history. Thank you for writing this book, and for giving me something new to learn about a time I thought I had pretty much exhausted all avenues on. I loved every part of this book, every death cut me, but I know it was war and it wasn't going to be pretty going into it. There wouldn't be roses and birds singing all through the story line, but they were there when it was most unexpected. A great tale very carefully and thoroughly researched and plotted out. Thank you for sharing it.",5,1

"This is the first one of Joan Smith's novels that I simply didn't like. I'm almost shocked by that, because her style and wit are in evidence in A Country Wooing. The entire story revolves around everyone's money troubles. These people were so self-absorbed it was hard to like any of them. Alex, just back from the war, must dig his family out of extreme debt caused by his now deceased father and elder brother. He works fairly hard at it, but comes off rather stupid toward the end. I don't know what he ever saw in Anne, the girl he always admired who, in turn, chased after the elder brother. Anne jumps to conclusions too. He cares for her, but no, he must surely be pursuing a wealthy cit's daughter. Not my cup of tea, but it will not keep me from continuing to read other Joan Smith titles.",2,0
i like the fact the main character was bisexual and not full on gay... cause i dont care for woman turning a gay man out plot. the one thing that i didn't care for was how one minute he was dead set on not having a menage with her and another man but yet the next minute he had no problem doing it with an unknown guy. i think there was enough scenes in the book to make you believe those two as a couple,4,1
This story is dark and extremely interesting. I guess I would consider it a psychological thriller. It was really good and worth the cost. I loved it!,5,1

"Royal Rebel is a new take on the old story of Robin Hood.  Princess Robin is the secret child of King Richard and she is known throughout the land as Princess Robin whom steals from the Rich and Gives to the Poor with her band of merry boys.Princess Robin is raised as a wild child and has no desires to fulfill her duties as a woman of her time.  Sir Simon takes every opportunity to teaser her, bate her and make her as angry as possible. Sir Simon is a Knight of King Richard and is trying to save King Richards true love from marring the fat Prince John. Robin and Simon are thrown together into a light and fun adventures that takes them from the Sherwood forest, though swampy mash lands, mountains so high and back down to Nottingham, looking for an artifact that will keep Lady Marion from marrying Prince John.  Robin falls in love with Simon over the course of their adventures because she realizes that he isn't what he seems.  Their romance blossoms and the author gives the reader a reminder of their first love, however there are several sex scenes in the book while not graphic I wouldn't want my young teen or teen reading the book.  I wish the author had created more of an adventure and less romance throughout the book, but that is only my opinion because I enjoy a good adventure and less romance.  I will however admit I did giggle like a school girl while reading the book several times.I also wish the author made Robin more physically strong and able to take care of herself and less I fallen and I can't get up.  Several times Robin talks about being able to take care of herself or knowing where she was going but instead she is lost or falling into quicksand or off the side of a mountain.  I feel it would have made Robin a bit more believable as a thief, the leader of robbers, if she was able to take care of herself.  I read this book remembering it is a self -published young adult novel and while it isn't going to win Pulitzer prize I think the author gave a fun take on a very old story.  It is a love story for the young adult who might not be ready for a strong adult romance but do not want to be stuck reading Disney romance story either.The author took lot of liberty in her choices of history, landscape and language used but at the same time it was an enjoyable teen\twenty something novel.  If you are looking for a quick summer romance with an adventure this book Royal Rebel is for you.Thanks Heidi for this review.",4,1

"The Bell family was haunted by a ghost who could argue a biblical verse, sing hymns, or belliger a family member until they went running from the house!  Written as a collection of individual interviews, various family members and friends talk about their experiences with the witch/ghost.  The writing is old fashioned and difficult to read.  The story itself is difficult to believe and modern readers should know they spend more time discussing the biblical discussions than the scary part of a haunting.",2,0
"Wow...be prepared to get all hot and bothered while reading this book. It's quite steamy.I loved that Emmy was a little pudgy and semi-insecure about herself. The story moves pretty quick and the characters are entertaining (especially liked the British/Irish lingo thrown in there).Good read, although the plot is pretty straight forward and there are zero surprises.",3,1
"When I first saw this cover on Facebook, I commented that I thought it was an ad for breast self examinations, and that would be a good thing. Then I somehow bought the book on Amazon and started reading it.  It made me think about all the different times and ways in which Cinderella has been presented in my life. Naked men and satyrs and pirates never really entered into it before.My first Cinderella was, no doubt, a little Golden Book Version and in 1965 I remember my mom being really excited about a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical that was going to be on TV (CBS) with Lesley Ann Warren and Stuart Damon (you know him from General Hospital). Mom was excited about it because Celeste Holm, Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon were in it. Lesley Ann Warren was a trained ballet dancer so that was going to add something. Perhaps my mother thought that would inspire me. I don't know, in ballet I always felt I had missed all the classes where we learned anything.Back then, in black and white on our thirteen-inch screen (which we had until 1972), it was magical. The music was great and I was transported. It did nothing for my career in the ballet school being taught in the fire station however.Then, in a service internship in college I interned at a state run theater and they ran Cinderella. Because it was the state we had all kinds of educational information around it. They discussed how the story was very old and they had traced it all the way to China.It certainly has had a lot of versions filmed and written throughout the years, I even saw that there is a Sin-derella from 1965. We also have the socio/psycho/anthrop-logical theories brought out of fairy tales. White knights, Peter Pan and uncomfortable shoes!What about this version of Cinderella? Queen Ella is now 31 and really horny since her Prince Charming turned into Prince Charles (ie. boring, unfaithful) and disappeared. The way she is described she reminds me of one of the Gabor sisters. She decides to hold a masquerade ball so she can find a sexual partner and incognito have sex with him.After she meets the man of her dreams at the ball but doesn't learn his name she decides to throw a second ball to find him. This time another fantasy is realized. After the second ball she realizes who her mystery lovers are. Forces, in the form of her mendacious step family in a neighboring kingdom conspire to keep them apart and bring back Prince Charming who is now a gay pirate.Will Ella and her mystery beau survive? Will Ella, Charming and his pirate lover get it on? Will Ella be cast out in disgrace? Or will they all live happily ever after?****This isn't so much a retelling as a sequel: Cinderella the Post-Charming Years.The intimate scenes are sexy even though I also found then icky. The sex wasn't terribly inventive. I had a hard time deciding if we were back in days of yore or in a post-industrial kingdom. They had a tub and bathroom with running water, but it did not seem they had cars or telephones.The book was highly predictable plot wise, although Prince Charming ending up being different than I thought he would be. It's possible I have read too many erotica books but I pretty much knew what would happen after the first 30 pages.Are there any redeeming qualities? Well Queen Ella comes off a mature,not dependent on men, and a good ruler with an egalitarian spirit. And, it isn't a retelling which was nice. The relationship between Ella and her beau is loving.I bought the Kindle version which was only $3.44. If I were to purchase a paperback I would, in all likelihood, buy something else. with the nearly $12 price tag.  Not great, not terrible. Not going to become part of my Erotica Library.",3,1
"This could have been a very good story.  If the author would have kept it a story about a haunted house, and trying to get rid of the ghost. There is not much of a ghost story to it.  If you like to read stories about the main character talking about her vagina, her period, and her sex toy that she carries with her everywhere she goes, on every other page,  then this is the book for you!  I found the writing juvenile and somewhat embarrasing. This story had no romance at all.  It was all about two horny people that werent getting any.  I wish I wouldnt have wasted my time on this book.  It was really bad.",1,0
"The story was quite good plot-wise. I had difficulty sometimes following which character was saying what because direct speech was not usually given its own line for easy following. A lot of swear words were included, which were unnecessary. I didn't appreciate the 'lack of editing' the author proudly apologized about at the end (Got this in January 2013). It made it seem like a rush for sales. That should not be done to the readers you are depending on for sales and word-of-mouth ads. 3 stars. It's OK. And there's a scene where he really needed to take a bath but fell asleep. Yucky.",3,1
"This book spans all genres - gay,  erotic,  cop,  paranormal.  Yet Victor Bayne feels like a real,  three dimensional person.  He's a gay cop,  who is also a registered psychic and can see the dead.  Though while other psychics say things like,  it' feels colder here,  it's got a femminine energy,  Victor is having complete conversations with them,  and finds it hard to block them out.In this book, the first of the series,  Victor meets Jacob and their relationship starts.  This book is setting up so much world building (though the world is identical to our own,  except that psychics are recognized and certified) that the other books feel stronger.  I love these characters and hope to spend a lot more time with them,  this is a keeper and a reread for me,  this series has legs!",4,1
"Reading a story from Kallysten always brings me similar thoughts:  each story will have some connection (either via series or in feel) to another of her stories,  the world will be unique and well defined, the characters will feel familiar even if I haven't met them before, and the paranormal twists will present a whole other set of options for a reader.Blurred Nights is no different:  consisting of a world that is seen in two other series, just with timeline and character adjustments, Kallysten brings another dimension to the worlds already established in other books.  While being familiar with the other series is NOT necessary, the writing and characters in this will have you searching out the other stories: this will certainly help to provide more insight into the connected worlds.Characters are beautifully defined and described, with personal insecurities and preferences that are easy to relate to and understand,  with conflicts  occurring as characters seek to overcome their differences and fears to make connections that are both imminently destined and oh so right.  There are sexy and sensual scenes that serve to enhance the connections between the characters so well defined and displayed by witty conversations and asides, obvious protectiveness and chemistry that is apparent to all.I received an eBook from the author for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.",4,1
"I was frustrated with this book. I really love Dohner's New Species series, but I'll have to say that I'm not going to be reading anymore about Zorn Warriors.I can respect Dohner's ability to create dynamic cultures in her books. I read Ral's Woman and decided to give Kidnapping Casey a try, but I honestly wish I didn't. I don't like the culture of Zorn (I can respect Dohner's ability to create it, but it doesn't mean that I necessarily like it). I get that its an Alpha Male borderline D/s world, but the way that Argernon and Casey's relationship played out just wasn't cool for me.I'll have to agree with other reviewers here that rape = rape, yes, even if your rapist brings you to orgasm. I thought it was sweet that Argernon cared about Casey so much. I get that she's a gamechanger for him. I don't like that he tied her up (twice) and after she repeatedly says no (twice), they still end up doing the deed and Casey's all right with it. Oh, and he ties her up afterwards, because he doesn't trust her. And keeps her tied up for days, even making her wear a chastity belt so she can't please herself, and parades around in front of her trying to make her want him. Seems like the Zorn guys are no better than their pointy-eared counterparts, the Collis. I did not like Argernon, because he never learns that it is not ok to kidnap and rape someone. Its not ok to replace 3 girls last minute and expect your new girl to accept you. And Casey just seemed like a silent victim. I felt sorry for her. Somebody said that she was strong and could hold her own... silent strength and holding on to her pain? Yea.I felt like maybe I would've liked this book better if it was drawn out a bit more. Like, I would've liked to see Casey go to Berrr and get unbounded. Then she could've dated and get Argernon to win her love. But whatever. This book is what it is. This is the end of the Zorn for me. I will continue to read about Dohner's New Species and Cyborgs, but I'm not interested in Rever or Berrr.",1,0
Not really a novel - just a study of the outlaw.  Should be in the textbook section.  My husband is an avid western reader but he hated this book.,1,0
Continuing the stories of the Westmoreland family as they all give in to love. Excellent read. Keeps you entertained and thinking about who is going to be the next one down.,5,1

"I recently read Dandelions in the Garden by Charlie Courtland, and became an instant fan of her storytelling. So, naturally I was very much looking forward to reading the book's sequel, The Hidden Will of the Dragon. Unfortunately, I was barely two chapters in when I realized this novel would be nothing like the first and was greatly disappointed as I continued to read.The main characters from Dandelions in the Garden, had stopped evolving with the ending of that book and instead digressed into hollow players in this drawn out and lackluster novel. The way the story was told had changed and by doing so, lost all appeal for me. There were also far too many errors throughout this book for me to over look. I had noticed some in the previous story but didn't pay much attention to them since the story itself provided a satisfying read, but Hidden Will of the Dragon was completely riddled with them! I understand this falls partly on the editor, or lack of one if that's the case, but either way it should have been picked through and polished before publishing.Hidden Will picks up where Dandelions left off but doesn't flow along with the original story quite right. I had grown fond of Amara, Elizabeth's lady in waiting, admiring her strong will and ability to keep her head when everything around her was falling to pieces. I had enjoyed reading about her romances and her troubles, about her marriage and the strong bond she and her husband had between them. In this book, there isn't a bit of that. Amara is weak, needy and someone I ended up not being able to stand. And then there's Elizabeth, who I no longer sympathized with and just like with Amara, couldn't tolerate. She was out of her mind, annoyingly self centered and her actions were pointless.I feel absolutely awful having to leave this review! I enjoyed the first book and had assumed the second would be an accurate follow up but it fell flat, very flat. The story was there, and could have been saved and written in a way where the reader still felt attached to the characters they had connected with before, instead of having to read far too many pages without being able to absorb it. I'm sure there are many readers out there who enjoyed this book, and I'm glad that they did! This is just my opinion and I know that doesn't mean others will share it, but I have to say that I do not recommend this read.",2,0
"I found this story entertaining and much too short. The story opens with a couple who has been married for six years.  The wife suspects her husband of keeping a mistress after she finds a diamond bracelet in their drawers and then later finds out that she was not the recipient of said bracelet when bracelet disappears. He picked up the bracelet for his brother unbeknownst to his wife, so the misunderstanding begins.Armed with her suspicions, the wife feels she needs to shake up their marriage and win her husband back from the arms of the phantom mistress. The books begins when she announces over breakfast that she wants to take on a lover. Her husband is reading the paper and not paying attention to the conversation, agrees with everything she says.  She feels that after six years of marriage and two children, their marriage has become dull and is concern that her husband has or will look for a mistress to spice things up.The two still love each other very much, but marriage for them has become somewhat a rut after six years.  So what does this couple do? They go through the charade of finding her a lover. He tells her he wants to help select her lover. She agrees and then blackmails his twin brother to pretend to be her lover and pursue her anonymously. Her husband also seeks help from his brother to play the role of the lover and pursue her (but not bed her), so she does not have the time to seek another lover. Neither is aware that the brother is the only one privy to the dual roles he is playing.In the end, the husband realizes that he had been taking his wife for granted and has not lived up to his promises of giving her the adventure he spoke of during their courtship. He also admits to his brother and himself of recently developing a wondering eye and possessing a feeling of restlesstness  He knows that he has been neglecting her and not telling her how much he loved her and that he was the one  responsible for allowing their marriage to fall into a rut. He then likens his comfortable marriage to an untended garden. That was a good analogy.I thought this was a sweet story, but felt it could have been longer with more detailed flashbacks regarding their courtship. I only caught glimpses of the wonderment that she wanted to recapture from the days of their courtship. I like stories with married couples who are not fighting. One sticking issue with me is the reference of the wandering eye. If you are as in love with your wife as you claim to be - should you have a wandering eye?  I had to deduct a star for these references.This is the second novel I read from this author and I am very impressed with her writing abilities to capture details of the moment.A recommend.",3,1
"This book had particular interest for me because I am currently living in Cambodia and am all too familiar with the landmine problem here. The author had clearly done his/her homework as the story was chock full of information on mines, how they are used and how they are disposed of. The characters were also well developed and the plot moved along quickly with enough unexpected turns to keep me interested.I know that the theme of the 'wounded warrior' who has to fight their own personal demons to solve a crisis is popular almost to the point of cliche' and I found it a bit overworked here with the protagonist's addiction to opiates. Consider this 'House' in military gear trying to stop a raging terrorist rather than an infectious disease. Aside from that, and the somewhat implausible ending, it was a good read worthy of a few hours of your time.",4,1

"Ok hmm.  I was excited about this book.I read it cover to cover so to speak .. in about 35 minutes.Bleh.Being the second book in the Jane Porter series, this picked up right where the first left off.Jane is a woman who was celibate for 2 years.  Apparently she is ""insatiable"" .. at least until Antonio awakened her desires.  In this book, their passionate D/s relationship has been enhanced by Santos, Antonio's best friend.  Yadda yadda ..It is one thing to write a series.  It is one thing to write a series of short novels.  It is a completely different thing to write a book that contains only a few scenes; most of which by the way, were your normal Joe Blow.  Seriously?I love this story.  I look forward to reading more.  The next book in this series, Reinventing Jane Porter is now on my kindle awaiting my attention.  I'm pretty bummed though.I like this author a lot, but if I can only look forward to 30 minute stories that cost $2-$4 .. I'm not sure it is worth it.I suppose I can recommend this MATURE book to adults only.  Strong sexual content.  Duh, right?  The length is very disappointing.  I'll let yall know about the third book.  If I write that review today .. I'll be totally bummed.",2,0
"This book really confused me. I was able to put most of my questions aside and enjoy the book for what it was- a Swiss Family Robinson story about teenagers.OK, now for my many quibbles:1) This book would be YA but there's lots of sexual innuendo and implied sex scenes.  Ok, so I guess I'm an old fogey and am forgetting that the young'uns are maturing way faster than before.  But this is what I really don't like about the book- the fact the ""adults"" in the story (defined pretty much as everybody over the age of 20) start pairing off with...the teenagers. Yup. The chief of teens instigates a rule that you cant have sex before age 16, and maybe a couple that is 16 and 20 or 21 is ok.  But what we have are, err, a mature mother of two (I think she's close to 30) and a 16 year old (she does joke about robbing the cradle but then follows up confessing she has erotic dreams about him).  Then there's a construction worker/handyman who has to be in his mid-20's at least, who gets in bed (but no sex! yeah right!) with a...14 year old girl.  I'm sure you will love the scenes where he fantasizes about her perky, err, bottom clothed in skinny jeans, and the day she wears a teeny tiny skirt.  Very uncomfortable reading this, to say the least.2) So, teens will be teens. Referring to my comment #1, the sex between the teens, though slightly unsavory, is realistic in the end.  Now, oddly enough, the premise for bringing them all together is the fact they were all attending an abstinence camp.  Whizz goes the irony! sorry, though, there were no religious connotations at all in the book. Nor did these seem like your bunch of bad behaving kids sent to labour camp. Is there really, really such a thing as an abstinence camp that is not related to the church? Did the author just choose this setting for the irony?3) Again, teens will be teens. I'm alright with some of them being more mature and taking charge, even if the Chief is a 15 year old. But what about the emotions? It really seemed the kids took one paragraph to get over the shock of being stuck atop the mountain...then boom, they are back to playing and chatting. No thoughts of mom or dad? Siblings? Friends back home? It's like these kids shrug at the fact life as they know it has changed drastically. Kids are resilient but to have none of them freak out and break down emotionally at the thought of being alone with no family is just really bizarre.4) The gender issue. Hey, I'm a girl and I once was a teenager. I will admit at one point, all I cared about was getting a phone in my room. I was extremely shallow with my clothing, makeup, friends. So no surprise at some of the girls' behavior in this book.  However, for ALL of them to be such sheep? The two girls who join the ""inner circle"" (the group in charge) admit that most of their acceptance by the guys  is because they're the ""girlfriends."" and then the Chief blurts that fact out loud. Reaction?  Nada. I think a few girls toss their hair and/or stomp off to pout. But that's really about it. Geez would it kill to have the girls actually gang up and retaliate a bit?5) The ""science""...or lack thereof. There's a weird fog surrounding the mountain. there's creepy stuff in it that kills. According to the prologue the fog is alien in nature or something like that. Ooooh. But then that's the only mention of the fog in that context. Dang it, would it kill to have one or more of the teens try to investigate the fog? Or the ""army specialists"" do some research into the fog?  Everyone just seems to lie back and accept it all. Not one thought on how to escape. Ugh!Well there's more but I feel I've ranted enough. If this weren't a free ebook, i would be a lot more pissed but at least I didn't waste money on this.",2,0
I will admit that the story was a good read but I also have to state that the story felt rushed. The main characters could have used a little more development and the secondary characters a lot more development. Happy ever after came to quickly for me given the magnitude of the plot. The story read more like an erotic fantasy than a realistic romance. In spite of these problems I will be reading the rest of the series.,3,1

"This is an absolutely awesome buy if you're interested in starting the Steele series. Loved all the stories in this book including the first short story of Dane and Sienna. Loved all the Steele brothers and cousin Vanessa' stories. Chance and Kylie had a sweet and very funny coming together. Lots of mischief. Sebastian(Bas) and Jocelyn had a feisty and rocky road to travel. Also in that story was the very touching and loving story between Jocelyn's sister Leah and Reese the man she loved but left behind without a word. Then you have Morgan who finally found Lena Spears, his perfect woman, even if she doesn't agree with him. Can't not love a beautiful man that loves your family too. Last but not least Vanessa and sworn enemy, the delicious Cameron Cody, who like Morgan has wanted his woman from a far for too long and is tired of waiting.

"3.5 Stars~Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogIf you&#8217;ve read Heat of the Moment, then you&#8217;re already familiar with Carson Scott. He&#8217;s a SEAL, a wild and sexual guy but the only different between him in this book and the guy from the last book is that Carson doesn&#8217;t want to be the one-night-stand guy anymore. He wants commitment and he wants a relationship.Unfortunately for him, Holly Lawson, the girl he had a hot quickie with in the supply closet of a club, doesn&#8217;t want to date him. She just wants a fling. As Holly proposes an affair, Carson is trying to get a hold of his feelings for Holly.In an explosive mix of chemistry, sexual tension and a heady dose of dirty talk, HEAT OF PASSION  ignites with a fiery passion. Kennedy doesn&#8217;t wait long to turn the heat up. In fact, she jumps right in, whether you&#8217;re ready or not.Though too short to really create a concrete romance between the two, this short story is a hot quickie, perfect for a little pick-me-up if you need something a little more spicy in your reading material.",4,1
"This is the first Star Wars novel I've read since the wonderfully adapted novelization of Revenge of the Sith by Matthew Stover. Sadly, Lost Tribe of the Sith: Precipice does not inspire me to continue reading expanded universe novels. While many readers find fault with the brief length of this novel, I found it to be the book's only saving grace (other than its price). Surprisingly, the characters in this novel are quite lackluster and are a far cry from the variety of Sith Lords we're accustomed to. Whereas the Sith Lords of the Star Wars films and previous EU books tend to be frightening figures, the 'humanized' Sith Lords in ""Precipice"" are poor ambassadors of the Dark Side of the Force.Perhaps this series will improve with successive books. But Precipice fails to deliver the kind of intriguing space opera that I love about Star Wars. Fortunately, Fate of the Jedi: Omen of which Precipice is only a prequel, appears to be a far more interesting read. As much as it pains me to say it, I would have a very difficult time recommending this book to anyone except the most die-hard Star Wars fan. Maybe John Jackson Miller will deliver the goods on the next go.",2,0
This bundle was very well written but what else do expect from Mrs. Romance herself. The Steele men are like stone but they began to crumble all in the name of love.

"Not your average everyday christmas miracle but one to remember none-the-less. Hot hot hot hotel room scenes. One even included a lil bit ol bondage & a gag.Nick and Holly meet in a gentleman's club which is actually a Christmas themed strip club. Holly has a normal boring job as an accountant but her best friend convinces her to fill in as Mistress Christmas. So this shy sexy account slowly burst out of her shell with a couple courage shots and embraces a wild side.Detective Nick West is at the club hoping to catch Mistress Christmas in the act...of stealing from her male customers. One look at Holly aka Mistress Christmas and he is hooked. He soon gets a lap dance he won't soon forget and just knows that he is far from done with Holly.Personally I prefer the authors other series spotlighting on the McKays but this was a great break from them and it was nice to read about a West boy. The Wests boys are cousins to the wild McKay bunch. It even made reference back to a couple of the McKay boys so if you've read the Rough Rider Series you'll enjoy that.This was actually an ebook from my local library that I got from an Amazon loan..so can't beat that. Was a quick, hot read that I did enjoy. I don't know if I connected with the characters like in the RR but overall still good.",4,1

"Angels' Pawn is an introduction to the world that we'll learn more about inAngels' Blood(due out 3/3/2009). A world where angels and vampires not only co-exist, but have an interesting connection. As a Guild Hunter, one of those that hunts rogue vampires down for the angels, Ashwini finds herself suddenly stuck between two vampire factions, and the angel wanting to manipulate them all, in Atlanta. She turns, for help, to Janvier, a vampire himself - who may have his own reasons for assisting her.From the first moment I started this novella I was immediately immersed in the world. I couldn't have stopped reading if there was a fire. Okay. I hope I could have at least paused to get out of the building, but you get the picture.I'm continually amazed by Nalini's ability to create fully realized characters, especially in novellas where the shortened format makes that difficult for a lot of authors. Angels' Pawn is no different. Ashwini is a compelling character from her first moments pounding on a door. I'm completely intrigued by her, and really hope that we get to see more of her in the future.Janvier. Wow. What can I say except I want to meet him. A native from the bayous, with an old world charm, and an, apparently, innate sexiness, he is just fantastic. Watching him play off of Ashwini, lightening the mood and at the same time ratcheting up their relationship throughout everything they were trying to accomplish in Atlanta was truly a joy.I can not wait to read Angels' Blood which focuses on Elena and Raphael, I believe. But I'm really hoping to see more from Janvier and Ashwini in the future. Their storyline was by no means complete - although the main conflict is tied up in the novella - we have lots more to hear about this pair.Nalini's said it, but I'm going to give this warning to those that need an HEA. This is not a typical romance with a bow-tied HEA at the end.It's a fantastic read, a great introduction, and I highly recommend it. If you've not read anything by Nalini Singh, I urge you to run out and buy everything you can by her. Her Psy/Changeling stories are absolutely fantastic, and this new series promises to be just as great.[...]",5,1
"At the time of this review, I Love My Kindle is the second best selling blog devoted to discussing the Kindle.  If I was going to subscribe to either one, I'm not sure which way I would go.The best selling blog isKindle Nation Daily: The inside scoop on all things Kindle.  That blog is focused almost entirely on the Kindle.  It includes hints on using the Kindle, articles about the Kindle, and free book offers.  I decided not to subscribe, for reasons I gave in my review for it.So, what's different about this blog?  While both blogs are oriented towards the Kindle, the focus is different.  The good news (for me) is that I Love My Kindle covers more than just the Kindle.  It also discusses the entire eReader ecosystem, including other eReaders, Publishers, etc.  The author also includes occassional ""humorous"" articles.  While I don't think that the author is a danger to those who attempt to make a living writing humor, at least he doesn't take himself seriously.  On the other hand, I haven't seen a single article about free books or other such items.  Also, it appears that the author of I Love My Kindle only publishes one article per day.All in all, while there are some things this blog does better and other things it does worse than Kindle Nation Daily, I don't think I'll be subscribing to either one of them.",3,1
This was too short of a story for the real horror to have the shock effect that it deserved! Would make a great story if it had been longer.,2,0
I thought this book was okay.  There were quite a few grammar mistakes.  I thought it was odd that the people in the beginning of the book were only mentioned a handful of times and that was towards the end of the book.  I did think this was a good read.  I don't know if I would recommend it or not because I have mixed feelings about the book.,3,1
"This story follows an unlikeable spoiled woman during a zombie outbreak. Her family life is shallow and her values are pretty dispicable actually. Her character was so unlikeable that it was hard for me to finish the story. She has an equally unlikeable husband and best friend who are cheating on her at the beginning of the story. A community of survivors develop with her leading the group. As the story progresses, the woman begins to slowly transform. Although she is not someone I would probably have close to me, she becomes braver and more likeable towards the end of the book which is probably the biggest piece of science fiction I have every read. No person can change this much even if they do go through the end of the world. As it has been said of this author's other books, this story needed a good proofreader. His style is getting better, but it still needs improvement. He really needs an editor. All in all a good story. I enjoyed it.",3,1
Weird book. I didn't like the way this book was written. It's book was very weird and sequence was weird.,1,0
"I have used my Kindle 2 and enjoyed it, replaced it with a Paperwhite then went back to use the Kindle 2 and discovered the elastic strap which holds the cover together, in the closed position, had failed.  Not broken, the material inside the strap had dissolved into a black mush.  This is a material design defect.  The Kindle 2, c/w cover, hasn't been exposed to any environment that would initiate this type of failure.",1,0
"After signing up for some free kindle book, I have a hodgepodge of reading material.  My usual thing is horror.  This book was fast paced and very interesting.  I sorta saw where it was going, but the end was still a surprise.",4,1
"Though this was a free download which purported to be perfect for fairy tale lovers, it turns out to be a kind of sickening representation of Rumpelstiltskin and some woman of ill repute. I just couldn't get interested, so quit reading in the middle of the second chapter. Perhaps I should have read on further, but I felt like I was wasting time on a not so happily ever after tale.",1,0
this is a good book for yaoi lovers however i did think that it could be made a bit longer or have a sequel as i'd love to read more about these two,4,1
"I read in the car whenever I'm riding with my husband. The car charger is a must-have. The cord length allows me to read while my Kindle is charging. I already have a wall charger, so I gave the one that came with this to my daughter. I am very satisfied with the products.",5,1
"Beware- spoilers ahead.  Read at your own risk.....I mean it, there are spoilers involved...I agree with Jules- the book started out with such promise- 3 guys falling for Truly and then... nothin'.  Two guys become playthings (even though they have feelings for her!) and her heart is given to Nate alone.  Um... what?  A total cop out from Alexander on that score.  Truly was expressing that she had feelings for all of them, then Nate throws a little tantrum and it's all ""I only lurv Nate?""  No, just no.",2,0
"The main character of this book spoiled the entire story for me.  She was selfish, self-absorbed and totally underserving of the hero of the novel.  She was not likable at all.  Because of her character's personality, the book just never seemed to end..... I was ready for it to be over long before the final credits.  Do something else with your time - don't read this book.  I'll give Ms. James another try but I hope her other books are more pleasant to read.",1,0
Somehow this terrible story manages to be both predictable and to leave you wondering how the plot even came together.I got it for free and I felt like I'd been robbed of my time.  I can't imagine how annoyed I'd be if I'd paid for this thing.,1,0
"I had a very hard time reading this book. Worst were all of the grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. ""Lose"" is spelled as ""loose"" more often than not. ""Where"" instead of ""were"" and ""murder"" instead of ""murderer"" over and over. Aside from that, the premise of the book sounded good, but I was 50% through it before it even got into what the description said it was about, so a very slow start. The ending was kind of lame. I just was not impressed.",2,0
"Not really impressed, not enuf development tween main characters. Brother was a hoot though. I skipped forward alot. Glad it was .99",2,0
"I liked the book. It wasn't great, but it was good. If you are reading all this author's books this is one to read. I enjoyed the story and never would have figured out the end until those last pages.",4,1

"3.5 starBRIEF SUMMARYAmber is excited when she meets her high school crush, Brain. Both had an instant attraction that led to a steamy encounter. When both encounters a misunderstanding, they still manage to not get along but physically wants and take each other repeatedly.THOUGHTSI thought this was a very spicy book. I am always first in line to read high school crushes who reunites later in life. Amber and Brain got together for a steamy night, but, with a misunderstanding everything goes wrong. Soon after and unable to get enough of each other with their bedroom aerobics, both characters steams up the pages with a sex only relationship. I liked that even though the relationship was purely sexual, we got to see Brain slowly learning and reconnecting more about Amber, and I found that to be sweet. Although I thought this story was sexually charged, and sweet, I found the storyline to be ok. I liked it, but didn't find myself connecting with certain scenes. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this book.Story: FAIRIntimacy: D.R.I.P = Don't Read In Public / GOODEnjoyment: FAIR to GOODRomance Novel Junkies",3,1
"This was a fun and quick read.  I enjoyed the storyline and characters very much.  I wish it was longer because I would have loved to have read more about these two.  But, sometimes we just don't have a lot of free time in the day.  So, this was a great book to read in one sitting.",5,1
Well written short story that may come across as a teaser for other books of the author but can easily stand on its own. Gory entertainment for readers with a preference for the perverted variety of killers.,5,1
"I didn't enjoy this book.  I read it all of the way through and it ended worse than it began.There were too many ""main characters"" to begin with.  The reader was given glimpses of each in their little ""flashback moments,"" but there was not enough to like any of them.  As others have noted, most of the characters came off as jerks--self centered jerks to be exact.  Because there were so many ""main characters"" each one's ""romance"" was given no time at all.  Seriously, I would definitely prefer one GOOD romance than 4 rushed jobs.  When you try to mish mash 4 romances together like this the characters are lost and the plot ceases to exist.This is billed as an ""Irish Romance,"" and I can only assume that is because everyone speaks like a bloody Irishman--despite the fact that only 2 of the characters are from Ireland.  If the author wants to make most of the characters American, then bloody well learn how they talk. The editing was poor but that takes a backseat to the lack of a plot and poorly developed and unlikeable characters.",2,0
"Timelapse only got up to two stars because I think the author does a pretty good job of creating his alternative world. However, his main character, Alex, was totally unbelievable. As opposed to another reviewer who like him and was rooting for him, I was praying for him to be shot dead. I forced myself to finish the book so that I wouldn't write a bad review in case it had a great ending.Alex is supposed to be a fairly intelligent assistant professor at a university. Now I can understand when the transformation first occcurs how one might be in shock and possibly do some stupid things. But his stupidity never ended. He quickly surmised that the world was very different and very bloodthirsty, but every time he found something different he started to act up in so as to draw attention to himself and his companion, thus endangering their lives. He can't find all of his relatives in the registry, so he acts up in public. He discovers there are no libraries, so he goes running off in a huge distressed huff. For some reason he was totally surprised when his money was no good, even though he knew this world was dramatically different from his own. On and on - he was shocked when anything was different from his world. No one, and especially not a well educated history professor, is that stupid, over and over and over again. I found this not only unbelievable, but also extremely annoying.",2,0
"I bought this book a couple of years ago, soon after I bought my Kindle and I have read it several times.  For me it's a keeper that I keep going back to in my Kindle ""Favorites"" collection.  Considering the book was fairly short, I think the author did an excellent job of developing Lark & Taran's characters and the sex scenes were smokin' hot.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the unfinished business with Nick & TJ.  They are secondary characters that practically beg for their own story and I've been anxiously waiting for their book, but at this point I don't expect Kinsey will ever get around to it.",4,1
"I was disappointed in this book. There are still good recipes in it, but some are just meat-centered recipes where they suggest you COULD make it vegetarian... I was excited to see a recipe for Tom Kha Gai (Thai Coconut Soup), yet in that recipe it only suggested in the introduction to the recipe that you could substitute tofu for the chicken, vegetable broth for the chicken broth and I think there was one more --- maybe soy sauce for the fish sauce. Now all that is true, but I was really expecting a recipe where it WAS a vegetarian version not just --- well, use vegetarian ingredients instead of what this recipe says. Not what the title suggests.Many of the recipes are really just links to online &#34;Instructables&#34; - which is not a bad thing at all, just sayin'.if you are not really looking for ONLY vegetarian recipes, then maybe this book IS for you.",1,0
"I did enjoy this. It was a short carefree read. It was all sex and not much plot, but I liked that. However, I just thought the ending could have been better.",3,1
"Note: I got this for free.  Principles fall in love, marry, have tragedy, split, get back together (YEARS) later through somewhat unbelievable happenstance.  Some of the medical stuff isn't believable to those of us in the field, but it's a light (reading) romance - so what the hey.  Plenty of angst while the two try to figure out how they feel about each other and where to go from here.",4,1
Emily and Jake `s adventure in discovering  a forever kind of love was heartwarming.  When Emily decides to have a life outside of work the problems and fireworks begin.  Jake resists a forever relationship so often that he has the lines down pat that is until his sparrow takes flight first.  Absolutely loved hearing Jake's thoughts.,5,1
"I enjoyed the book and the characters I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because I too feel that the author could have backed off a little with all the erotica. The story line is a good one but needs to be developed more. Some reviews were complaining about the link between rider, dragon and sex. If anyone who has read the"" Dragonriders of Pern"" series would know this has already been established in Dragon fantasy lore. However where as the Pern series down plays the sexual side of the relationships Maiden Flight is in your face erotica. I do agree there needs to be a warning that this is an ADULT dragon fantasy novel  and not for young adults.  The series has great promise and I'm hoping that the next book goes more into the story line with a little sex thrown it ;)",4,1
Read this book first this book will give you insight into The Lord of the underworld. Just love these books find out in what order they should be read in and start with this book then go on you will be hooked.  When you read the last one you will always want more!  So enjoy the read and if you get the chance listen to these book on audio to when put together they are wonderful Max Bellmore is wonderful for reading theses books.  So enjoy!,5,1
"Before reading 65 proof, I had read other works from this author. Those titles include The List, Origin, Whiskey Sour, Bloody Mary and Disturb. So its fair to say that he's a safe bet and keeps the hits rolling.In reality, some of these stories are sold as stand-alone ebooks. But you&#8217;re really getting  10 eBooks for the price of one. If that isn&#8217;t more bang for your buck, I don&#8217;t know what is.But I&#8217;d have to say that 65 proof is not only a good introduction to this author, but you&#8217;re also getting many genres across the board and you&#8217;re saving money by buying this book.This massive ebook collection is separated into 4 parts: Jack and Friends (any stories related to his mystery thriller series starring heroine, Jacqueline Daniels), Crime stories, Horror stories and Funny stuff.You&#8217;re led through these stories, and through his publishing career, as the author himself gives a brief intro to each story. Once you become familiar with his wit, it turns into a major selling point for each story. I&#8217;d sometimes laugh as he jokes in between them as he sets up the next tale. He&#8217;s also really good with Flash Fiction (stories in 500 words or less).Right off the bat, we&#8217;re treated with some clever Locked Room mysteries which I wasn&#8217;t a fan of before reading this book. But he came up with some really clever stuff. My favorite stories had to be the ones with Phineas Troutt, a hard-boiled dying man who generally doesn&#8217;t care about ruffling feathers or dishing out some old-fashioned justice. He has a gritty attitude that draws you in.The crime stories were equally hard-boiled as well as equally unpredictable. The Agreement story was especially chilling.The Horror section was good. One story stands out the most and that is The Screaming. It&#8217;s the most original concept for a vampire story I have read yet. It was also written a different way. I liked the style of it.Another good one is Symbios. This Sci-fi horror kind of reminded me of Stephen King&#8217;s Survivor Type story but with a compelling stranded on an alien planet angle.All told, I haven&#8217;t finished every single story. I&#8217;m 90% finished with it. But I know that it is a majorly meaty collection of stories which will intrigue you, wow you, shock you, drop you, sock you and keep you reading all night.There&#8217;s something for everyone.",5,1
"Gregor is living the high life. He has been dubbed the Vampire King of New York - a cheeky title that the media love without realizing how close it hits to the truth. Gregor is the second eldest of the Faustin brothers; from the Russian vampyr family line. He runs a series of successful clubs, made famous for the fact that they cater to New York's vampire population - a publicity cachet the clubbers love, and the vampyrs appreciate. Gregor has his pick of women, and is at the top of his game, so the last thing he needs is for fate to interrupt his life. But when you're a Faustin vampyr, you have to listen when destiny speaks . . . or suffer the consequences.Gregor is told the name of his intended bride - Madelena. But Gregor ignores the heads-up and continues on his partying ways . . . unsuspecting, until fate intervenes with a crash.`Bound by Blood' is the second book in Evie Byrne's `Faustin Brothers' trilogy. Though it is the second book, the plot timing seems a little out-of-sync with first book `Called by Blood'. In this book, Alex is a rampant bachelor and is yet to meet his wife, Helena. So really, it would make more sense that `Bound' be the first book in this trilogy, instead of the second ...I am really liking Evie Byrne's `Faustin' trilogy. I love the fact that Byrne is writing a modern vampire tale - her characters are clued-up about vampiric myths and fanged pop-culture icons, but there's also an old-world vibe. Each brother finds his bride through premonition - fated by their mother who has dreams of her future daughters-in-law. In `Called' Alex was ecstatic to finally find his bride, partly because his older brother had recently settled so well into holy matrimony. But as we back-track, it's revealed that Gregor in fact found fate to be rather inconvenient. I love that Byrne marries some old-world mysticism with modern inconvenience - a New York vampire club owner who is put-out by his destined bride. Hilarity ensues when fate intervenes, brutally.In `Called by Blood', Byrne took a very different romantic route - by severely burning her Alpha hero, and leaving him looking like raw hamburger meat. Byrne does it again in `Bound', this time posing a difficult dilemma before the heroine. I won't give it away, but I really liked the hurdle before Gregor and Madelena, if only because it completely turned the tables on the traditional vampire/mortal romance.I like Evie Byrne's paranormal romance. Once again, I wish the book had been longer, mostly because I think the really interesting part of the story would have come in the aftermath of the romance. But again, wishing a book to be longer is a fairly decent complaint.",4,1
"I was a disappointed that it seemed to drag along.  I guess was expecting a more engrossing read that l got. Still an interesting book, just a little slow.",3,1
Can't wait to read the next book in this series. If only i could find a few lovely men like these..pass me the ice,5,1
"Set in Regency Era England in 1806.  Caroline was the Abigail to Lady Eleanor whose deathbed wish was for her to pose as a distant relative and start a new life at the family's country estate ""Castlegate Manor"".  Geoffrey, the groom, helps her but he has secrets of his own.  I enjoyed this light and entertaining read and would have given it 4-1/2 stars if that were a rating option.  The drama and suspense were mild with no graphic violence or sex scenes, only chaste kisses and embraces between the hero and heroine.  A nice little romance.",4,1
"I appreciated this book as a memoir of the author's life: an interesting Native american man.  I enjoyed all of the content until the last chapter, which was (suddenly) a dirge for all that was lost after the wave of European immigration.  I would have loved a chapter before that, to transition from the (relatively) good times to the clearly bad times.The writing is light and clear.  The legends are well recounted, and the anecdotes are well-told.",4,1
"This is the third book of his that I have read and I really enjoy them. They have great plots and characters, but aren't  overly complicated. My husband and I have a second home in Rancho Mirage (which is in the Coachella Valley) and we go to Palm Springs a lot and it's fun to read about a place that I know so well. I love his attention to detail and descriptive way of writing that draws you into his books. I would definitely recommend his books and I already have!",5,1
I found most of the short stories entertaining  so I will look for these authors. Thanks for the preview so we find never books to read,4,1
"I have read a few of  Ms. .Vaugh's books and out side of the animalist tendencies of the male characters, I really enjoy the believability of her characters and the apparent love her H/h have for each other.  For a paranormal tale, the characters are pretty realistic and the sex is HOT.  Good stuff....",3,1
"I like David and Jeremy from the earlier books in the series, namely Hidden Force and A Helping Hand. I am glad the abused David gets his HEA and there could not be a better choice than Jeremy to help this tormented man to heal. But close to 58% of the story is sex which is just too much for me. How do I count this. If you read it using Kindle it is easy especially when the first sex scene stops at 33% of the book. So while the sex is well written it is just too much. And why does a guy has to finally top or bottom, when he is reluctant initially, just to prove he is finally ready to take the plunge in a gay relationship. I like the plot, which is like an extension of the story in Hidden Force, and the guys. But this one just has too much sex even if well written.Hidden Force is still the best in the series.",4,1
"A fun, quick read that delivers your bang for your buck;-) I would definately recomend this book to *certain* friends, lol!",4,1
"I really liked the story overall and enjoyed it, however adding say 1 more chapter to cover each of the 5 days spent at the contest would have helped bring the characters to life more, and fleshed out the story more. We could have seen more of what went on, (I know I would have enjoyed that, these are interesting characters) and gotten deeper into the story. Perhaps a little more of Margo playing hard to get, drawing out the romance and seduction.For a longer story I would definitely add another star.The author is definitely talented.",3,1
"There is nothing better than getting a book by an author whose work I enjoy reading and the book is free (pssssst it's still free until Dec 15 - download it now!).Holiday bound by Beth Kery is exactly what you would expect from her. Don't know what to expect? Well this is not your Mother's romance. Holiday Bound is a short, sexy, sizzling erotic story. This book should have come with a disclaimer. I'm surprised my Itouch didn't instantaneously combust as I was thumbing through the pages. Yowza I was feeling all hot and bothered and it wasn't just because I was working out! I could've used a fan and a tall cool drink of water (ok I did have that close at hand) while reading this E-gniting, erotic E-read.It's Christmas. They're snowbound...no electricity...no way out...no help on the way and only each other to warm the long cold night ahead. Is this a recipe for disaster or a wild fire about to burn out of control? Dear Santa: if you're planning on coming down their chimney - you better watch your boots don't catch on fire.Alex Carradine left the big city and his life as a mover and a shaker in Chicago 4 years ago when he decided to chuck it all and retreat to Holiday Valley to run a ski resort. Alex is sceptical and with good reason when his estranged father Mitch wants to visit for the holidays and bring his latest and greatest main squeeze along for the ride. Maybe hell has frozen over, but Alex is willing to give Daddy Dearest the benefit of the doubt and what better time to try and rebuild their relationship than Christmas....a time for giving.Of all the dumb luck! Alex can't believe the woman he's just rescued from the stranded SUV on his property is Angeline Kastakis...this is his Dad's new girlfriend? Angeline...the woman he fantasized about 4 years ago and hasn't been able to forget? And where is Mitch? What is his father up to now? Is Father Christmas playing a cruel joke on Alex by tempting him and his willpower with Angeline Kastakis? And to top it off...now they're home alone for the holidays.Angeline is conflicted about her feelings for the intense and gorgeous Alex - son of the man she's in a relationship with. She agreed to this little get-away with Mitch so they could explore their relationship and hopefully take it to the next level. But Alex is a force to be reckoned with when he's in full out attack mode...and he's got his sights on Angeline. I might have had a momentary twinge about how easily Angeline caved to Alex's aggressive approach considering she was supposed to be dating his father, but I got over it quickly. Alex is a take charge kinda guy.There is lots of steamy, smexy action including interestingly enough an explicit encounter involving some gym equipment...mmmm...I may never look at that equipment the same way again. It also probably explains why I was breathing a little extra hard.Want to add a little Christmas present to your E-reader? Download Holiday Bound, sit back and enjoy.",4,1
"The set-up for this story was interesting - a man called Simon is imprisoned in a mental asylum and meets Gabrielle Howell, a woman determined to save him.The plot was quite absurd but I was enjoying the book until the sex scenes started.  Now I appreciate a well-written love scene as much as the next reader but the author really went over the top with the sex in this one.  The scenes aren't badly written, they're just so frequent that I found myself wishing the characters would stop bonking each other and get on with the story.  After a while it was just seizure, bonk, repeat.Things got a bit muddled once the Rakehells made an appearance.  There were so many of them (as well as their wives!)that I started skipping over those sections.  Fans of the series, I'm sure, would find these bits interesting but it was very confusing for a new reader like me.Frequent typos throughout the book were also annoying.  This one gets two and a half stars from me.",3,1
"Sleight of Hand was one of the purchases I thought could go either way, I'm very much into the spooky paranormal aspect of it so I thought I'de give it a try. So glad I did. While its a bit short and because of the story wraps up fairly quickly but overall I enjoyed it! Well written for sure,some parts keeping me on the edge of my seat wondering. Its a great progression of events with a serious plot twist in the end which I won't ruin of course! The main character is mysterious and enigmatic he drew my attention the whole way and of course the trials and tribulations of his love interest as well. As with any story I wanted it to be longer but of course all good things end. Well worth my time and money",4,1

"TheThe New York Timesis considered one of the ntion's finest papers, although some have stated that its leftist bias negates any value in the paper. However, a bigger problem with the paper is its size and cost.In my youth, I used to read about half of the week day edition in about four or five hours. (I don't want to estimate how long it would take to read the Sunday edition.) Now that I'm older and have family, a career, and a life, there is no way I could devote that much of my life to reading a paper.In addition, the cost of buying the Times is high, even on a Kindle.So the Times has taken an interesting approach to the Kindle. In addition to making the full paper available, it has also made sub-sections of the paper available through Kindle Blogs, at a much cheaper price. This blog is the best selling NYT Blog, but you may be more interested in one of the other NYT Blogs, which are listed on an Amazon Listomania list.  (I'd include the address here, but Amazon blocked it so go to my profile for the list.)The Latest News blog is a blog which is updated several times a day with the latest articles from the Times. Most of the aticles are hard news. However, occassional sports and lifestyle articles also appear, as well a very ocassional analysis article. Other than the analysis article, there was very little opportunity for any leftist bias in the articles.Unlike most current newspapers, the articles in the Times tend to be longer, with more background and context.There are two downsides to this blog. First, the New York Times is a New York paper. Some of the news articles will be New York news. Not many, but a few of them. If you live in Florida as I do, you may wish to skip those articles.Second is the transient nsture of all Kindle blogs. If you see an article you want to read later, TURN OFF YOUR WIRELESS until you've read the article. Otherwise you may loose the article with the next update.I have also occassionally lost sync with Amazon's servers. If your subscription doesn't update, just restart your Kindle. It will take a minute or so, but it gives your subscription a kick in the pants and starts updating again.I've been looking for a current news blog. Now I've found it.",5,1

"I'm new to erotic romance, and I have to say I'm hooked.If you like a hero who's alpha with a big heart, this is the book for you.  You know right off the bat how he feels for his Jule's, and you are rooting for him to get his girl. Ross wants to take his friendship with Julia to the next level, and you so want him to succeed, he's just got to show her just how good it could be between them. He's gentle, but rough and loving, but honest and to the point.I like my heroines who are independent regarding their career, but not so saavy about their personal life and don't know how to get what they truly desire.Sometimes the heroines come off as total *itches in these romance books, and your left to wonder, what the heck did the hero see in her in the first place, This is not so with Julia (though I did want to slap her upside the head at one point.), you know the deep affection these to have for each other, and the fear of losing that connection if they take a huge step over the line of friendship to romance.Love this book and also enjoy the fact that Julia is not a svelte supermodel, but a real woman who's got natural curve, we need more books like this.",5,1
"It was nice that the couple in this story were already married and trying to work on getting their marriage back on track. It showed that with work, couples can work out their problems.

I thought the reason they split in the first place a bit odd when Mandy could have easily gone to school where Kip went to play Hockey.I didn't really connect with the characters of Mandy or Kip. I found Kip going through his box of memories from his time with Mandy a bit girlie. Even his messages to her on facebook were a bit girlie. He wasn't very manly for a hockey player!I got bored reading it. Yes it has some sex scenes but there was just something about how it was written that didn't hold my attention. OK for a freebie, but doesn't make me want to read more by this author.",2,0
"This book could not have come into my life at a more perfect time. I have been wanting to change and trying to figure out how to make things different in my life and was completely overwhelmed by my lack of ability to do it. This book has really given me some new direction about how to improve my life and the things I want to accomplish. Christopher has such a unique writing style that allows him to put such a vast amount of information into such a way that everyone can relate to his successes and failures. This book gives you all you need to know in a step by step method but not only that, Christopher explains the reason people fail and also how to push past that. I have already started using my new found knowledge of manifestation and positive thinking and have seen a change.",5,1
"It's been nine years since Breanna Parker has been home, but her sister's wedding leaves her no choice but to return to the place where her heart was broken. Troy Youngwolf has never stopped loving Breanna, but a youthful drunken mistake forced him to marry her best friend. Something that Breanna has never forgiven. But he's a widower now with a daughter and he's determined that Breanna give him another chance. Breanna can't wait for the wedding to be over so that she can get out of town as quickly as possible and away from Troy. Although she still has feelings for Troy, she can't get over his betrayal and no matter what he does or how he tries to explain, she simply wants to leave. Preferably before he breaks her heart again.I have to say, I usually really, really enjoy Elaine Hopper. As soon as this came across for review I wanted it. However Always a Bridesmaid left me feeling more frustrated than happy. I could have easily forgiven Troy his mistake but his late wife was such a cardboard character and the reasons beyond ""he was drunk"" were never really provided. So I never really felt that the book delivered the character depth that I needed to get past the betrayal and see him as hero material. Especially considering the way he just up and married without giving Breanna any warning. And without that depth I was frustrated by the constant barrage of characters who were on to Breanna to just forgive as if she was somehow in the wrong. Ms. Hopper still can put together a compelling storyline, but Always a Bridesmaid just missed the mark for me.MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",2,0

When psychos meet this is how it must go and though a bit disapointed with the ending I could not put this book down.  Would recommend this book for the likes of myself that is someone who hasn't time for a long book but does enjoy the thrill of being involved with a great cast of characters.,5,1
"First off, I really don't understand the negative reviews about getting this magazine on your Kindle.1. You can also read the magazine on your iPhone.2. The hard copy magazine type/font is very small, folks. You can easily increase the font size on your Kindle or phone.3. I have read about 3 or 4 of the magazines on my Kindle and have found very, very few typos. Really don't understand that gripe.4. Yeah, it's a little cheaper through the mail but you can cancel your Kindle subscription any month you want to. Kindle edition is also available immediately. Have not seen that on the news stands. They're usually way behind.5. The nay sayers probably don't have a Kindle or they would know the joy and simplicity of having your entire library on your Kindle or in your phone. I work outside and can access these magazines or books at any time. Awesome!Okay, back to the magazine itself. It is simply fantastic! I also subscribe to ""Asimov's"" and ""Fantasy and Science Fiction"" magazines in the Kindle format. I've finally figured out, after 40 years, that the best SF stories are in the short story format, like you find in these magazines. Just simply amazing. If I'm a few pages in on something that isn't interesting to me, I just head on to the next story. Rare, but it does happen. No complaints here. Great, great magazine!",5,1
"Darkest Fire, available so far only as an e-book, is a short story that is a prequel to the Lords of the Underworld series but it is completely standalone, no Dark possessed Lords here.  Instead it is the story of the origins of the box which originally imprisoned the demons before being intrusted to Pandora.  It is a beauty and the beast style romance between the beastly Guardian of the Gate to the Underworld and the beautiful Goddess of Opression whose strength keeps the walls of the Hell intact and the demons (lust, death, wrath, disease...) from being unleashed on the mortal world. It very much has the same type of feel as P.C. Cast's Goddess of the Rose with the romance between a creature that sees himself as so ugly that doesn't dare to hope that the beauteous object of his affection could see beyond his skin to his noble heart, it also has a similar type of bittersweet happily ever after. I thought that this was a nice little tease to the series before it hit the bookstores, and now that the books are out it's a brief 'just so' historical note to the series, since the box is what got all the Lords into an eternity of trouble.  One caution though to readers, if you find a love between beings of two physically different species uncomfortable, this may not be the story for you.",4,1
"Well I spent 80% of my time tilting my head like a dog listening to a strange noise. I mean it is very interesting, but also very confusing at times. It was a little dizzing for me.

"At first this book was OK. The author was a little wordy, and gave way too much description. But it wasn't too bad. I was interested even if I was flipping through the filler. But then the Mary Sue of a heroine became a titmouse. Literally TSTL. I don't want to spoil anything, but if you can have phone sex with a man, you can ask him about himself. Trust goes both ways.Aside from some of the stupid things that went on in this relationship, the hero had this way of blackmailing the heroine that I did not like. Also he's a poopyhead :PBut to sum up, the book is overwritten, and the main characters defy belief. Would not recommend.",1,0
Ok. So I've seen this book for a while now and I couldn't decide whether I wanted to read it or not. Now I wish I went with the latter choice. I don't think I made it past five chapters before giving up. The main character is completely stupid. Why go running in the forest you know has demons in it and then when you meet the demon what do you do? Make out with him. Yea so believable. Not to much the writer writes like she has adhd. I read a review where the girl said she had to re-read paragraphs to really get what was going on. I had to re-read pages. It was too much. Not even worth the free price.,2,0

"I promise to be brutally honest with my opinion, but it should not be taken as fact. Any reader should read it for themselves, before they decide if this book has any merit or not. Do not judge this book biased solely on my opinion. If you do, you might miss out on a great read. You never know. It could happen.1. Strong Main Character/ Female Heroine: Lhung is a bit girly at times, but he comes off as a weird man. I am not sure what to make of him. He is mysterious and I am interested in finding out more about him. He seems like he is fighting some kind of inner demons and I like inner demons. 4 out of 5 stars2. Strong Minor Characters: Taus is intriguing. I want to know more about this mysterious girl with the gorgeous violet eyes. At times, I find her very dark and menacing, but she switches quickly back into a pretty little girl. I do not know if that is the author's intention or not, but I find it very compelling and interesting. I love her vulnerability mixed in with some naivety. She is the perfect foil to Lhung and I hope that he does not mess things up with her and that he pursues her. 5 out of 5 stars3. The Setting: There are a few different places that the author takes you to, but mostly the graphic novel is centered on the characters and how they look. I think if the author would add more of a setting to her book, it would make the novel more interesting to read and discover the world in which her characters live. 3 out of 5 stars4. The Plot: I wish there was more of a plot, besides the little love story in the making, but this is only the first chapter so I can hardly fault the author with that. I just wish there was a little bit more background information about Lhung being a dragon, because this concept is very confusing for me and I am really into the fantasy genre. I like how that mysterious man showed up and I want to know more about him. 3 out of 5 stars5. The Artwork: The characters are beautifully created and the precision just blows my mind. I do not know how the author can create such beautiful drawings and they really are a sight to see. Her drawings are better than a lot of Chinese, Japanese, and Asian graphic novelist. The use of color is very important in this novel, because the author uses color so rarely. So I cannot help but think and notice that the colors are very important to the book and holds special emphasis and hidden meaning. This is not your little brother's comic book. This graphic novel is for mature readers; however at this point, there are not any erotic moments to deem it XXX. 5 out of 5 stars6. The Writing: Okay, I will admit that at times the writing needs a little work, nothing a little proofreading would not cure, but other than that, I found the writing is satisfactory enough for a graphic novel. I do find that the writing lacks style or distinction as a unique work by the author; however, since the author's specialty is in creating beautiful artwork, you cannot expect the writing to be just as good as a novelist. 4 out of 5 stars7. The Dialogue: Sometimes, the dialogue can seem a little forced and slow going. I understand that this is only the first chapter and that the main attraction is the lovely artwork, but I believe that the dialogue needs to hold the reader's attention as well. A little improving an this graphic novel would be excellent and a perfect 5 star. 3 out of 5 starsThe overall rating is 3.86 out of 5 starsReading this graphic novel has inspired me to come up with three new categories to critique. The more books I read, the more in-depth my reviews become and this is just the new updated version of all of my reviews. So a personal thank you to the author for inspiring me to be more critical of her work and for allowing me to praise your work better.",4,1

"First of all I should mention that I couldn't bring myself to finish this book. I stopped after ca. 40%.I like fantasy, werewolves and vampires, in general. For some reason I just don't seem to be able to like this genre in mm-literature. Especially werewolves, because of the ""mating"". Two guys see each other, and suddenly they're supposed to live and love each other for life. No build-up, nothing.Well, I wanted to give this genre another try. (AndLone, for example, wasn't that bad, after all..).This one, however, is the most boring and unimaginative story that I've read/started in this genre so far.This is, in general, what happens in the beginning:[Be warned, the beginning might be too exciting for some of you. I really don't intend to cause a heart attack or something ...]Laine: ""Hey, you're my mate.""Dev: ""Seems that way.""*Both start having sex.*After that (next morning) the 2 characters make plans for family introducings etc. for the next day.No build-up. No suspense. No tension. Nothing!Well, that's exactly what happens, there are more words in the book of course, but that doesn't really make it more interesting.Whatever happens next (I gave up on it before), it might get a tad more enthralling, but I'm already too fed up with the beginning to really believe that it's going anywhere near ""great"", not to mention ""sublime""..But don't let my opinion scare you away from it. If you happen to like a werewolve and mating plot in mm-books and have no problems with immediate mating/falling in love, with no build-up whatsoever, who knows, maybe you'll like it...",1,0

"Up until the point where the author wrote that the Pope Pius XII and the Catholic Church did nothing to help the Jews, the story was engrossing. However, the author didn't do his research well or he would have learned the truth. The black legend that said that the Pope did nothing to help the Jews may be the 20th century's most enduring lie. Historical documents prove that he did whatever he could to save them. His dilemma was how does he speak out without further endangering the Jews. He went to the edge of risk and he saved hundreds of thousands of Jewish people. Many he kept hidden in the Vatican and others were hidden in convents and monasteries. Hundreds of priests went to the death camps for speaking out against Hitler.I, a Jewish woman, gave this book one star because of this major flaw.",1,0
"What to say?  This book is just wonderful. I am normally not a fan of apoplectic fiction, but this book transcends that genre.  It is adventure on a grand scale condensed into a small but varied cast of characters.  I loved it and honestly feel that it will appeal to a broad range of readers.",5,1

Off the bat, theyre trying to get in Christina's pants for a life time relationship... are you kidding me? Serious?

"UPDATE: Warning to other reviewers of this work:Among books I've reviewed, the helpful/unhelpful ratings of reviews of this book seem unusually tied to the number of stars in the rating.  My review here doesn't particularly stand out as biased or unfair in comparison with my other reviews, yet it's garnered an unusually large number of 'unhelpful' votes.  No comments have been left regarding the deficiency of the review, which is also suspicious.ORIGINAL REVIEW:----... regarding the author's long-winded, detailed descriptions, as described by other reviewers here. I do think it's a worthy book nonetheless.For a particular example of the tediously descriptive nature of the writing, very early in the book the author spends a couple pages on describing the main character's clothing, which serves absolutely no plot purpose.  And even though his clothing is obviously mended/repaired/replaced again and again, it is never subsequently described.I can also sympathize with the 'Harry Potter-ish' nature of the plot.I would give this a 4-star if the main character didn't annoy me through the whole first half of the book whining about his self doubts and obviously flawed arguments regarding a lack of worthiness.I think there's a lot of potential in the author... but like most authors, I imagine if he read his own early work (presumably such as this), he's say ""ugg.. I wrote this?""So on to the good parts... after the main character stops whining, the plot becomes reasonable.  The interpersonal relationships/interactions are quite good and consistent, particularly in the second half of the book.  The writing flows fairly well, with relatively little awkward phrasing.I'm not unhappy having paid $0.99 for it... I'm not sure I want to pay $3 for the sequel when I have a lot of other $0.99 stuff to read.  (If you note my purchase/review history, I obviously do follow up for many $3 sequels in various series, I'm just not convinced on this one at this point.)",3,1

"delightful book about an artist who lost her mojo and talks to her dead husband in the cemetery, and her friends and the townspeople in the small Vermont town of Rounded Corners was first published in ummm the 90's, I think, went out of print and now the author has brought it out in eformat.  Yea!Maud started off as a little girl who was being raised by her widowed father who allowed her to paint on the walls, and the furniture and wherever she wanted.

"I thought the writing on this book was amazing - it hooked me at the very beginning.  The cover is awful, don't let that distract you.  However I ended up deleting it from my Kindle without finishing it.  There were just a few things that I simply couldn't get past.SPOLERS in my review, I'll do my best to keep at a minimum.First, I felt that the ""love"" happened FAR too quickly - I didn't buy the feelings at all, there just wasn't enough time for that sort of depth to develop, even if you believe in love at first sight.  Second, Two accepted that she was a vampire far too quickly - I didn't buy that either.  The main problem I had with this book was the lack of emotional depth.  I thought the writing was amazing - gritty, and more explicit in some ways than I normally prefer but as I said, it pulled me in.  I just couldn't get over the fact that the relationship didn't seem real to me.  I wish I could have because I think the direction this writer was going in as far as vampire lore was fascinating.  I'd give him another try in a different series, see if he is able to get the emotional side right, but I can't read anymore of this one.",2,0

I read Will's story first, book 3Heat of the Storm: An Out of Uniform Storyand then Ryan's story next, book 5Heat of the Night: Out of Uniform, Book 5, with Ryan's being my favorite out of these three. I'm glad I read those others before this one, as I think they are much better stories overall. While I enjoyed Heat of Passion, it didn't do as much for me as those other two stories did. Although it is a sexy read, it's not quite as hot. And I really felt more of a connection to Will and to Ryan, their characters being just more developed for me. Sure, Carson is sexy and sweet, but he just doesn't have that strong appeal or depth. Neither does Holly for that matter. I do think the writing and the series/stories are a lot better and sexier later on, having a bit more weight to them. This is a very quick read, nice but just not interesting or hot enough.",3,1

It took me a week to read and a book of this length would normally only take me about two days. I just had to keep putting it down. There were many run-together words. The dialog seemed very formal to me, not at all what you would expect people to actually be saying to each other. I really couldn't develop any feelings for any of the characters at all, especially Lorne. I really think with some professional editing this could be a much better book.  Needless to say I won't be reading the next novel.",2,0

It's like a normal every day marriage - there was lack of communication and I was so happy that during the read they were able to figure out what they needed to figure out, talk about what they needed to talk about, and work it out. Oh I just love the whole series and can't wait for March 2013. Once again J R Ward outdid herself with this short story about the now happy lil perfect family!",5,1

"Andrew Buchanan was a man that had everything.  He was the proud owner and head chef of the Blue Fish Grill.  More importantly, he had the love of his life Sidney McCall, and they were about to celebrate their first anniversary.  Drew thought the perfect gift would be to indulge one of her deepest fantasies of a m&eacute;nage with his best friend Brody Nash.  He wanted nothing more than to give Sid everything she ever wanted, and keep her happy.  While he loves her with his entire being, she has never reciprocated his declarations of love, and that left him dreading for the other shoe to drop.  He was afraid that maybe she didn't have as deep of feelings as he did.Brody Nash was the true definition of a free spirit.  He was an immensely talented desert chef, but couldn't keep his feet planted in one spot for any length of time instead choosing to sail off at any given moment.  He loved women, but never kept any of them living up to his bad boy reputation.  He had no real relationships except the one with his best friend Drew.  They had a special bond usually reserved for close brothers, and that was exactly how he thought of Drew.  When he asked Brody to be the third for a special anniversary celebration with Sid, he couldn't believe his ears.  Surely, his best friend was not suggesting that they share the women that had possession of his soul?  When Brody finally agreed, no one was prepared for the ramifications to them all caused by their combined actions.This was a moderately entertaining read, but not a keeper.  The characters are not fresh, and the story falls flat.  Drew had no business initiating a m&eacute;nage into a relationship he was so unsure of.  It screamed of desperation on his part, and he deserved everything that happened to him.",3,1
I did enjoy this novella. I say that because it is not book length. I liked the story and the writing was good. I would buy #2 and #3 if they were 99 cents.

Heat of the Moment may be short but it certainly packs a punch and is a very hot introduction to Elle Kennedy's Out of Uniform series. Shelby has been crushing on Garrett for over a year but no matter how hard she tries to flirt with him he just doesn't seem to pick up on her signals. Then when she overhears him discussing her with a friend and talking about how tame she is she decides to prove him wrong by suggesting a m&eacute;nage. What she doesn't realise is that Garrett has been fantasizing about her forever and that while he's happy to help her fulfil her fantasy he has every intention of claiming her afterwards.This is a fairly short novella so you can't expect a huge amount of characterisation but if you're looking for something fast to read staring two incredibly hot Navy SEALS then you can't go wrong. Garrett and Carson sure know how to show a girl a good time and I wouldn't have minded stepping into Shelby's shoes for the night! Although we don't get to know a great deal about the characters there was enough of a back story for me to believe that Shelby and Garrett would make a good couple. Garrett's actions did irritate me for a few minutes towards the end but I forgave him quite quickly and it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the story. I'm also very excited to spend more time with Carson who I believe he's the hero of the second book in the series.,3,1
"While this book had some redeeming qualities, the best being the friendship between Jasmine and Wiley/Rihlia, I just cannot get past the fact that (slight spoiler) the male protagonist/love interest feels that it is all right to restrain and touch the heroine in a sexual manner even though she is furious and telling him no. Sorry, but that's rape. Even if she gets turned on, it's still a form of sexual assault. And we're supposed to root for them after that? It left a sick feeling in my stomach.",1,0
"This book really turns up the heat. If you can't handle or don't like books that involve sexual relations, then do not read this book. I really enjoyed this story, it was very interesting to read about. The romance part was pretty good, but I wish there was more. I know it's a novella, but I would have really liked to have seen more from it. There was more sexual aspects to the book than actual romance which I didn't like. Me having read book 2 first, book 2 had a lot more romance development in it. But overall, I did enjoy the story and it really brought some flaming heat! I can't wait to continue on with the series, because I love books dealing with military men :)",4,1
"This prequel introduces a fantasy universe and a couple characters.  The universe was intriguing enough, just, that if there were more I would have kept reading for a while to see I wanted to spend some time there.  The characters, while not masterfully developed, were interesting enough, and had an interesting enough dynamic between them, that I would have liked to keep reading.  However, I see from other reviews that this prequel takes place some generations prior to the rest of the story.  I'm not interested enough in this universe, at least for now, to pick up on the story in the future with a new set of characters.

So Saskia went to a bar dressed pretty much like a hooker to try and pick up Mark, or hoped to pick up Mark her friends boyfriend. The plan was that if Mark didn't respond to her sexy ways then he was ok and obviously not cheating on her best friend. At the bar, she spots the sexiest man she's ever seen and assumes it's Mark, but it turns out to be Andreas ""her new boss"" who she tries to pick up, and he rejects her advances. The following day she goes to meet her new boss and guess who? Andreas, the man who she has not been able to stop thinking of. He needs a fake fiance so his grandfather will stop trying to arrange a marriage with someone he can't stand. I don't want to tell you the whole story, but it was very good and I recommend it even though it didn't have a lot of conflict and it kept going over and over the same thing.",4,1
This series is super! Each story has such a great hero and heroine. They each a have a fun quirky storyline. The sex scenes are hot! Loved being in bear creek for a few hours. Will definitely be buying more Lori Wilde books.,5,1
Could use help in the innovative thought processes.  Some Vampire stories sex scenes are much better written.  Cover art was sexiest part of the book.,1,0
"""SPOILERS""I just got done reading all three books in the Vaughn series that are currently available and enjoyed all three of them.  My main issue with this one however is how quickly Candice gets over her experience of being raped...in one weekend she goes from barely being able to cope with talking to people at the gym, to sleeping with the hero...and it just seems as though it moves a bit too quickly...but the book was a good read and i'm eagerly awaiting the next one in the series due out early next year about their cousin Grace",3,1
Love this story great quick read for me description above. this one is a keeper.,4,1
"Inspiring and I was already a believer as I have my Mother with me sending me messages Thanks to John Edward who shared with me freely with love some use their gift for profit this man is all about teaching, validating,and inspiring.

"After a long introduction about the downfall of the horror novel, how few horror stories they are left, and how this book had ""real, haunting horror"", I was preparing myself for a collection of really stellar, frightening short stories, and instead I got... well, while none of them are what I would call poorly written, they also aren't what I would call particularly memorable or scary in the slightest. Nearly every story herein is some sort of ghost story, but it's less ""The Grudge"" and more ""here are some ghosts, they have some unfinished business, but they're trapped, sorta, and that's sad I guess?"" It should be said, naturally, that horror is entirely subjective, and what one person finds scary another will find boring, but all of the stories within Ashes don't actually seem to be trying to be scary, unless all of the writers have some sort of different definition of the word than I do.The problem with most of them is that they seem to lack any real point... there is rarely any sort of resolution, usually only a sort of token conflict, and most of them just kind of peter out with an ""oh well"" sort of vibe. One story, revolving around a pregnant woman abandoned on a farm, actually felt pointless, confusing, and downright silly to the point where I actually went back over it to see if I was missing something, or if a few pages had stuck together. Ashes makes for an entertaining read if you're looking to pass the time and relax for a few minutes, but there isn't much substance here, ghostly or otherwise.",3,1
"A Wolf and a cougar? It was good, she left he went after her, they work things out and they do fall in love.",4,1
This is a great book on the insight of  Life in the first generation of tanks of world war one.,4,1
I didnt like this book too much. The sexual content was mostly about having a threesome which i didnt find romantic at all. The author has other books that are way better.,2,0
"This is a great series by Lee Driver.  I downloaded the first book in the series about 2 weeks ago and I just finished reading the last one out there.  I loved, loved, loved this series.  The characters are great and their interaction is amazing.  If you like paranormal mysteries with a little romance added in you have to read these.  I hope there are more books coming in this series.",5,1
I am a great fan of Gena Showalter and this series but this was awful. I am convinced she did not write this book. A big waste of my time ...Now I see why they HAD to make this book free.,1,0
"Again, a good story, sullied somewhat by the descriptions of the characters emotions, I find myself not reading theses pages, just skipping over them. Sequel is a true &#34;what happens next&#34; book, enjoyed it mostly.",3,1
"After reading DEAD(ish) Book 1 I immediately purchased the other two books of the series.  I liked the concept of this book but really Cooper was way too whiny for me to be able to deal with.  I still enjoyed the dark and crude humor that carried over from the first book but I didn't really care for the overall story or character development for this one.  It felt really flat for me and I didn't feel any real emotion at the end of the story.  I was just kind of glad I didn't have to read about Cooper anymore, he was just so annoying.  My thoughts on Cooper, however, had nothing to do with his love for computers or that his heaven is inside a computer.  Heaven is whatever you make it so I understand their ""ruling"" that Cooper is OK with where he is because at least he's moved on.  I love the idea that the author wrote this story about a total nerd who is so into video games.  But being a gamer myself and knowing many people who play the types of games that are referenced in this book, I found the stereotype gamer used in this story to be pretty insulting.  Linda, however, was awesome and I loved her reactions to the stupidity that was Cooper.  Because of that I completely related to her, I seriously just wanted to strangle Cooper through the whole story.  Too bad he was already dead.Conclusion:Least favorite out of the three by far but would recommend it if you enjoyed the first one and would like to continue reading about Linda.  Reading about her character alone makes up for my lack of interest in Cooper and for $.99 it really is worth it.",2,0
I thought this book was okay it was like really short I was really disappointed it was that short ugh,1,0
His explanation make perfect sense..... once he tells you. They are a fun read and a great break from the present day mystery writers.,4,1
"I've read many books from Stormy Glenn. While hardly literary masterpieces, I hold them to an admittedly lower standard than I do other novels. They're fun and sexy and are very light, but entertaining, reads. While I normally rate her books between three and four stars, I gave this one a five star review because it did evoke some heartfelt emotions.Ryce and Saul are mated werewolves. They're deeply in love with each other. The only blemish on their relationship is that Saul heads into town every Friday night to seemingly ""sow his oats"". This slowly eats away at Ryce, and their relationship is gradually going down the tubes, even though Ryce is still hopelessly in love with Saul.When Ryce's frustration reaches epic proportions, he decides to head into town too to see if he can have some fun. There, he runs into Cary and recognizes Cary as his mate. Cary is a tri-omega, a werewolf assigned two mates to help keep them grounded. Once claimed by one mate though, a tri-omega must be claimed by the other in the near future, or die. Even after claimed by both, they must be continually claimed every few days or they whither away. Ryce knows a bit about tri-omegas. He knows that fate doesn't assign a tri-omega two mates without those two mates being assigned to each other. Since he and Saul are mates, Saul must also be Cary's mate, so Ryce goes and claims Cary. When Saul comes home though and finds Cary and Ryce asleep together, he's heartbroken and feels betrayed, even though he knows he's been putting Ryce through the same thing. Cary leaves Ryce asleep in the bed and comes downstairs to meet Saul, but the drunken heartbroken Saul is so jealous and angry, he sends Cary away.The is one of the better stories of the series. There's a lot of emotional angst. We have Cary feeling the elation of discovering his two mates and finally being mated, only to be thrown out by Saul and knowing that he'll die soon without them. We have Ryce who cannot abide by Saul's cheating excursions into town anymore, but still is madly in love with him. We have Saul feeling great self-shame over what he does every week and the fact that it hurts Ryce so much. And then we have the growing realization that whatever it is that Saul does every week, it's not cheating, it's forced upon him, and he must keep his mouth shut and let everyone think he's a scumbag for their own protection.There's some nicely heartfelt scenes in the story that surprise. Such as an argument between Saul and Ryce that turns into lovemaking, but during the lovemaking, it becomes apparent to Ryce that this is Saul's goodbye. Another piece of dialog that tugs the heart is a conversation with Micah, another tri-omega that can sense emotions. While everyone is sure Saul is cheating, Micah informs them that whatever Saul is doing, he's not cheating. Micah can feel Saul's love for Ryce, and it almost fully consumes every other emotion and is the driving force behind Saul. These touches at heartfelt romance to the story, elevating it above just normal erotica.It's a pretty complex tale that is sexy, romantic, exciting, and intriguing. It's one of Ms. Glenn's better stories in the series. I normally wouldn't give a five-star review to light tales like this, but since it does rise above the others, I passed on an extra star to it.",5,1
"I read about 25% now, and there's still no hint of any romantic interest from any main character. Other than that major disappointment, it's too mundane and slow most of the time, with too much redundancies and things that go without saying, as if written for slow-wits.",1,0
I love every book that I have read by this author! All of them are extremely sensual with a pinch of humor.,5,1
"I had no idea this fell into the gay/lesbian genre, but even if I had I wouldn't have expected this book.  This book is an adolescent gay wetdream.  The protagonist serially rapes everyone who works for him and they supposedly love it.  His violent take on sex, his utter apartness from his hapless waiters and busboys and cooks, his overweening pride in his cookery, all created such an unattractive story that within a few pages I sent it back off into the ether from which it came.  Bad book, bad, bad book!  Down there, I say sir.  It reminds me of an unruly pet.",1,0
"i have to say, id never read any of biance d'arc's books before, this was recommended to me and im so glad it was, a brilliant story with characters, you'll fall in love with.this is the first book in the series, and after reading this book i went out and bought the rest of the books",5,1
"I loved this book. It was one of the first books I bought for my new Kindle and I thought I did rather well. I bought this one simply because I wanted to read a retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story. I got much more than I bargained for and loved every minute. It was one of those books that made me sad when I had finished it because I wanted it to keep going on. Loved the prince - what a great character and Beauty herself, is a very worthy and unusual heroine.It is funny and sad and a great commentary on our treatment of beauty queens. I liked the ending. It was totally unexpected but brilliant.The sorceress behind the scenes is a marvellous character.I absolutely love this author and I hope she writes many more of her quirky fairy tales because I certainly will be grabbing them.",4,1

"H Beam Piper will stand as one of the greats of sci-fi/fantasy for as long as the printed word exists, whether you are a mystery/thriller, detective novel or space opera/alternative universe fan, Piper delivers. In H B's writing you will find the forerunner of many who followed in his ginormous footsteps, (federated terran space, space vikings, even his place names have been copied by later writers! Aldebaran sound familiar)? Great reading, great fun and a must for anyone who really wants to be lost in another space/time continuum!",4,1
"I really liked this short story. The  spirit animals bring them together to start over great idea. The short story was enough to make me read the series.Thats saying something because I'm not reading new series {new to me} I'm reading to many as it is, but I love the whole idea of this. I liked the writing style, that it wasn't jammed full of useless things. But yet you got to know the couple, & the world they lived in.",4,1
"Sera was finally back home in New Hampshire after a long two-year absence to face her demons.  Her psychic abilities were what led to the sabbatical in Arizona, but it was her emotional psychic connection to Jake Candellori that caused the ultimate humiliation, and need to flee.  Sera thought they had something special, but when her barriers were down when they made love, and her emotions overflowed, Jake had literally bolted.  She needed the time to learn to control her psychic senses, so she never had a repeat of her experience with Jake.Jake hated spring snowstorms, but he hated them even worse when his suv rolled after hitting a deer.  The snow was coming down, and he knew he needed to find shelter from this storm.  After walking for a half hour, he spotted lights from a house in the distance.  He made it to the door, and practically fell in when the door opened.  When Jake regained consciousness, he found himself plastered next to an almost naked Sera.  He hadn't realized she was back, and had exhausted all his contacts trying to look for her unable to stop thinking about her since she left.  He knew how badly he had treated her, but she had obviously decided to permanently close him out talking about inane things that didn't matter.  Jake was determined to get her back in his life, and would do whatever it took to make it happen.Sera and Jake had chemistry and a connection.  Jake's willingness to read up on psychics, and become informed was very endearing.",4,1

"I was wanting a bit more; the story was short & sweet, however I felt the ""what he thinks, he thinks"" was a bit redundant and it was lacking a bit in the sexual build up. I think I would have enjoyed the story more if instead of the morning aftermath, it started a couple of weeks prior to the ""Big Night"". Sexual Tension is always better then the morning after jitters...",3,1
Great read.  This one would be a great one to have in every school so children would grow up knowing what black people were struggling with in the 1800's.,5,1
a lot of Bianca D'Arc since I found the first paperback in a book exchange store. It was Lords of the Were. After that I was hooked on her books. I have read this whole series and liked each one equally. I love knowing the characters from the former books as I read about the lives of what were the supporting characters in a previous book. Would highly recommend reading this series.,5,1
I really loved this series. I think this was the best book in the series. I enjoyed Dane and Solange story.,5,1
"Cat's Paw is so very well written. Taylor just draws the reader into the story--like magic.  on one level nothing seems to be happening. On another, so much. I highly recommend this book.",5,1
This story is great for breakfast and lunch with the storyline and I love story between themselves and their love,4,1
"The storyline was very unique.  I am not going into the plot, because others have described it.  What I DIDN'T LIKE, was our H was nothing but a bully and was very demeaning in the first half of the book towards our h.  What I LIKED about the story, was the sex,  it was raw, very imaginative, and hot.  There was somewhat of a  story, in between the sex.  I didn't feel a connection to any of the secondary character's to read the rest of the series.  The next book is only 96 pages and is $2.99, at least this one was free. (ljb)",3,1

Sasha doesn't want to step over the emotional line again, even though one look at the luscious hunk is enough to tempt an angel to sin...To be honest this kind of confused me. I got that it was an erotica. I got that it was futuristic. I did not however understand the competition. She didn't really delve into the whole rating part or what all was involved. This wasn't my favorite erotica I've ever read. I usually enjoy erotica but this one had just a little too much voyeurism, and the story line bounced all over the place. This was also supposed to be a romance, and it lived up to that much better. I enjoyed the play back and forth between Antonio and Sasha. All in all this book wasn't that great. I would give it a 3/5 it wasn't the worst thing I have read but wasn't the best. I will try another book by this author and see what that brings me.",3,1
